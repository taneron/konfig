    # Just Eat API

    Just Eat offers services for our various business partners and our consumer
    applications.

    How you interact with the API depends on the services you wish to interact
    with.

    ## Security

    ### HTTPS

    All api calls and callbacks require HTTPS. Your service will need a valid
    SSL certificate and be accessible via the standard SSL port (port 443).

    ## Making an API request

    Some API calls require an API key, to authenticate the partner calling the
    API.

    ```

    PUT https://uk-partnerapi.just-eat.io/orders/abcd1234 HTTP/1.1

    Authorization: JE-API-KEY abcd123456789

    ```

    Other calls require a user token in the form of a JWT.

    ```

    GET https://uk.api.just-eat.io/consumer/me/orders/uk HTTP/1.1

    Authorization: Bearer abcd123456789

    ```


    ## Date Formats

    ### Date and time formats

    All dates and times should use the [ISO 8601 standard for representation of
    dates and times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).


    #### For instance:

    * DueDateWithUtcOffset: `"2015-05-26T14:52:35.5444292+01:00"`
      - Local time: `14:52`
      - UTC time: `13:52`
      - UTC offset: `+1hr` (due to daylight time saving)
    * DueDateWithUtcOffset: `"2015-02-03T11:10:00.0000000+00:00"`
      - Local time: `11:10`
      - UTC time: `11:10`
      - UTC offset: `0` (no daylight time saving, local time is equivalent to UTC)

    Note that the offset may be for a timezone different to your own, so you
    should always convert to your own local time for display purposes (e.g. on
    receipts and terminals).


    ### Callback timestamps

    Timestamps sent to Just Eat should be recorded as the current local time
    (including any changes needed to account for daylight saving) with an
    accompanying offset that shows the difference between the recorded local
    time and the current UTC time.


    If it is not possible to record timestamps in local time, timestamps may be
    recorded in UTC time with a 00:00 offset.

    ## Async Webhooks

    Some of the webhooks on the platform are configured as being 'async'
    webhooks. These are for long-running operations, and work as follows:
      1. Your webhook is invoked with a `?callback={returnUrl}` query string parameter. The `returnUrl` is a unique URL that you will need to send the async response to.
      2. Return an immediate `202 Accepted` response from the webhook endpoint, to indicate that you have received the request.
      3. Perform the long-running operation. This can be deemed either a _success_; or a _failure_.
      4. If the result is a _**success**_, return the following:
      ```
      POST {returnUrl} HTTP/1.1

      {
            "status": "Success",
            "message": "{successMessage}",
            "data": {}   // webhook-specific response object
      }
      ```
      5. Otherwise, if the result is a _**failure**_, return the following:
      ```
      POST {returnUrl} HTTP/1.1

      {
            "status": "Failure",
            "message": "{failureMessage}",
            "data": {}   // webhook-specific response object
      }
      ```

        Final picked order is for brands that may make amendments to an order
        and want to receive a copy of the order in its final state i.e. after
        all amendments have applied. This can be integrated or non integrated.
        please contact your brand manager for more information. after the
        initial order injection has already taken place (e.g. due to items
        potentially being out of stock), and would like to be notified of these
        changes to the initial order.


        Once the order has been picked (currently the trigger point for this is
        the "last mile delivered" event), the platform will check for any
        amendments on the order, and send the "final picked" order back to the
        specified endpoint.


        The "final picked" order could be different from the original order, as
        items may have been marked out of stock during the order pick. As such
        the total price, or item quantities may have changed.


        In the event you would like to receive the final order, there are
        several combinations of injections you can subscribe to.


        ### Scenario 1 (receive only the initial order)


        Receive only the initial order  in the state it was originally placed,
        at the point the driver is prep time away from the store. JET Connect 
        will send the order to the "Received Order" endpoint, as a `POST`
        request. Your endpoint must be able to receive orders in the same format
        documented in the "Received Order" section.


        ### Scenario 2 (receive only the final pick order)


        When the order is picked, the JET Connect Platform will check for
        amendments, and send a request to the final picked order endpoint you
        provided with any changes, as a `POST` request. Your endpoint must be
        able to receive orders in the format documented under "request format".


        ### Scenario 3 (receive both the initial order, and the final pick
        order)


        If you would like to receive both of the requests documented above, this
        is also possible. Please contact your brand manager to have this
        configured.


        #### Request format


        As an additional security measure, orders can be sent from the same
        static IP address as the initial order. You can request this feature
        from your brand manager.

            called within 3 minutes, the order will be marked as failed to

      description: >-
        When an order is received for your integrated restaurant on a delivery
        website, the JET Connect Platform will send it to the endpoint you
        provided, as a `POST` request. Your endpoint must be able to receive
        orders in the format documented below.


        As an additional security measure, orders can be sent from a static IP
        address. You can request this feature from your brand manager.
      responses:
        '200':
          description: >-
            To indicate that the order was successfully processed, return a
            `200` status code with an Order Number. JET Connect will notify your
            delivery partner that the order was successfully processed.

          description: >-
            If you would like to handle the order asynchronously, return a 202
            status code. JET Connect will place the order in a pending state,
            which will fail after 3 minutes if you do not notify JET Connect
            through the Update Order Status endpoint. If this endpoint is not
            called within 3 minutes, the order will be marked as failed to
            inject.

      summary: Update the availability of menu items
      operationId: ItemAvailability
      description: >-
        The Item Availability API allows you to manage which items on a menu are
        available for ordering via your delivery partner (Just Eat, Skip The
        Dishes, Menulog or Takeaway).


        Menu items are marked as available or unavailable via requests to the
        Update Item Availability endpoint described below.


        # Features


        - Static endpoints for updating Item Availability. These endpoints do
        not include brand and location references in the endpoint URL, making it
        easier for operations teams to onboard new restaurants.

        - The ability to update multiple menu item availabilities in a single
        request.

        - Coming soon: more detailed error messages, including whether the
        operation failed when attempting to publish your update to the delivery
        partner (Just Eat, Skip The Dishes or Menulog).


        # Response


        If the menu and PLU references are valid and the request was accepted,
        you will receive a 202 Accepted response. The specified menu item should
        appear as available or unavailable on the delivery partner website (e.g.
        Just Eat, Skip The Dishes, Takeaway) automatically within less than 5
        minutes.

        Use this endpoint to ingest menu(s), creating a baseline per menu
        received.


        # How it works


        The JET Connect Platform API allows anyone with a Just Eat, Skip The
        Dishes, Menulog or Takeaway account to automatically publish menus from
        their POS to the respective delivery partner. For this to work, client
        applications need to:


        1. Extract menu data from their POS

        2. Use this data to create an HTTP request in `JSON` format (see format
        details below)

        3. Send the request to the menu API endpoint:
        `https://api.flytplatform.com/menus`


        The API endpoint will validate the incoming request and, if checks are
        successful, publish the new menu to the delivery partner. We recommend
        checking the delivery partner page to see if the new menu has been
        updated as intended.


        # Features


        - Static endpoints for publishing menus. These endpoints do not include
        brand and location references in the endpoint URL, making it easier for
        operations teams to onboard new restaurants.

        - Ability to update menus for multiple restaurants using a single
        request.


        # Response Format


        If the menus are valid and the request was accepted, you will receive a
        `202 Accepted` response. The new menu should appear on the delivery
        partner website (e.g. Just Eat, Skip The Dishes, Takeaway) website
        automatically within less than 5 minutes.


        Note: currently, our platform only checks if the menu structure is
        valid. However, a valid menu may still fail to publish on the
        corresponding delivery partner platform. Currently, this endpoint does
        not indicate whether the publish operation was successful, however this
        is an item on our future roadmap


        # Asynchronous Callbacks


        If a valid callback address has been specified, shortly after the
        synchronous response indicating initial acceptance or rejection of the
        menu, a POST request will be made to the address detailing the eventual
        menu state.


        See the callback object for more details.


        ## Nutrition and Servings in menus - Under Development


        This version has initial support to provide nutritional information and
        servings in your menu data.


        *This is still **under active development** and it's currently not
        supported by any of the delivery partners. Nutritional info and servings
        in menus will be available in the **UK only** from 6th April 2022.
        Restaurants in the UK territory are able to integrate now with our
        platform API with full testing and rollout to happen from mid - end
        February 2022 onwards.* **Please note that it is mandatory in the UK to
        have nutritional information for brands/restaurant groups with over 250
        employees ([UK government
        guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/calorie-labelling-in-the-out-of-home-sector/calorie-labelling-in-the-out-of-home-sector-implementation-guidance#displaying-calorie-information)
        link).**


        Here are the additional attributes covering `nutritional_info` and
        `servings` under `items`, `options`,  or `portions`.


        See sample payload "Menu with nutrition and servings".


        ## Grocery items in menus - Under Development


        This version now has initial support for you to provide grocery items in
        your menu data.


        *This is still **under active development** and it's currently not
        supported by any of the delivery partners.*


        Here are the additional attributes to add under `items`, `options`,  or
        `portions`:


        See sample payload "Menu with grocery items".


        ## Translations - Under Development


        We will be beginning support for menu translations shortly, to any
        platform which supports it.


        This section will contain further information on supported platforms in
        the future.

                the synchronous response indicating initial acceptance or

                address detailing the eventual menu state.


                As a single address is defined for a collection of menus which
                may be associated with multiple restaurants, a separate request
                will be made to the address for each restaurant.

        Marks the order status of a pending order as failed to inject. 

        This does not mean that the order is rejected, as the order will go
        through the backup flow, if any.


        Orders are marked pending when you respond to a call to the Receive
        Order endpoint with a 202 status.


        Requests to this endpoint for an order which is no longer pending will
        fail.


        If this endpoint is not called within 3 minutes after an order is marked
        as pending, the order status will switch to "failed to inject".

        If you are receiving multiple transmissions for the same order, e.g.
        Initial and Final Picked Order, then you need to provide the
        Transmission ID from the order payload in the request body.

        This webhook will be invoked when we have determined that an order is
        ready for preparation. Upon receiving the request, you should perform
        any preparation-related activities, such as sending the order to the POS
        system / kitchen screen.

        **NOTE:** This version of the webhook is asynchronous, and we expect a
        response in two parts:
          1. We expect an immediate `202` response from this webhook to denote that you have received the request;
          2. Following that, we expect an [async callback](https://uk.api.just-eat.io/docs/) - indicating either success or failure of the operation. The body for the async callbacks are as below:
          
          **Success callback**
          ```
          {
                "status": "Success",

      summary: Updates restaurant's opening times
      operationId: PutServiceTimes
      description: >-
        Update the service times in your Just Eat / Menulog restaurants,
        overriding the ones currently present on the restaurant.


        Note: This feature is currently only available for integrations with
        Just Eat and Menulog.


        ## When to use it


        By availabilities on the menu, we mean what times you can order from a
        specific menu.

        By service times, we mean restaurant opening hours.


        It is possible to push the same menu to multiple locations however, this
        means that all the restaurants need to share the same availabilities on
        the menu.


        By using this endpoint you can “override” the service times for a given
        restaurant, so you will be able to push a single menu and then
        individually select the service times.


        ### Scenario 1


        You push 1 unique menu with availabilities `17:00-21:00` to ten
        locations.


        Since one of the locations closes earlier at `20:00` you can now use the
        service times endpoint to update the opening hours for this location.


        ### Scenario 2


        The breakfast menu runs from `09:00-11:00`  but the restaurant needs to
        close at `10:00` due to driver shortage. You can use the service times
        endpoint to update opening hours.


        ### Scenario 3 - Limitations


        Menu availabilities are `8:00-12:00`. The restaurant decides on the day
        they want to open earlier at `07:00`. The service times endpoint cannot
        be used to update opening hours as you won't be able to place an order
        at `07:00` since there is no menu for that time.

        Instead, you would need to re-push the menu with revised availabilities
        `07:00-12:00`.

        This webhook will be invoked if we experience an error or timeout in
        sending an order to the underlying POS / kitchen screen. When notified
        via this webhook, typically you will perform some form of alerting or
        backup flow (e.g. ask the operator to enter the order manually into the
        POS). NOTE: This message contains the `OrderId`, but not the full order.
        It is assumed that you have stored/cached the full order details earlier
        in the flow - e.g. via the
        [/order-ready-for-preparation](https://uk.api.just-eat.io/docs/)
        webhook.

            general error, but different values are there to make custom
            handling from client side possible.

            shift ) at the time, divided by the number of time periods gathered
            from all data points. Differently from simple moving average,
            exponential moving average also represents the usage however its
            equation places a greater weight on the most recent data points.
