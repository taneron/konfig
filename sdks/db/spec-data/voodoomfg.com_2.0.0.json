The API will look for the key in the \"api_key\" header of the request. <a href=\"https://voodoomfg.com/3d-print-api#get-access\" target=\"_blank\">You can request a key here.</a>\n\nThis API provides a programmatic interface for submitting printing orders to Voodoo Manufacturing. The general process for creating an order is as follows:\n  - Get a list of the available materials with the /materials endpoint\n  - Upload models to the API with the /models endpoint\n  - Get quotes for shipping methods with the /order/shipping endpoint\n  - Get a quote for an order with the /order/create endpoint\n  - Confirm the order with the /order/confirm endpoint\n\nUploaded models and orders can be retrieved either in bulk or by id at the /model and /order endpoints, respectively.\n\nIn some cases, you may wish to get a quote for a specific model without the context of an order. In this case, you may use the /model/quote (if you've already uploaded the model to the API) or the /model/quote_attrs (lets you quote based on calculated model attributes) endpoints.\n",
