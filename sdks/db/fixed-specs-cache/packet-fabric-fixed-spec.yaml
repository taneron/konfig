      Use [/v2/auth/login](https://api.packetfabric.com) endpoint to get the
      token.



      Use that token and "Authorize" button to authenticate your requests.



      You can also use that token to authorize your `curl` request:


      ```

      curl -X GET "https://api.packetfabric.com/v2/activity-logs" -H "accept: */*"
      -H "Authorization: Bearer 12a30d30-20c0-4f62-a982-eb1424631094"

      ```


      Python code to authenticate and utilize the

      [Bearer
      token](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/):


      ```

      import requests

      login_url = 'https://api.packetfabric.com/v2/auth/login'

      login_payload = {
          'login': 'admin',
          'password': 'p4ssw0rd'
      }

      r = requests.post(login_url, json=login_payload)

      auth_token = r.json()['token']

      request_header = {
          'Authorization': f'Bearer {auth_token}'
      }

      contacts_url = 'https://api.packetfabric.com/v2/contacts'

      r = requests.get(contacts_url, headers=request_header)

      ```


      *For resellers only*:


      To make the request on behalf of reseller's customer - add `On-Behalf:
      customer UUID` header to the request:


      ```

      curl -X GET "https://api.packetfabric.com/v2/activity-logs" -H "accept: */*"
      -H "Authorization: Bearer 12a30d30-20c0-4f62-a982-eb1424631094" -H
      "On-Behalf: 11111111-2222-3333-4444-eb1424631094"

      ```


      *For API Key Authentication*

      To utilize an API Key instead of login/password, you will need to generate a
      key and save the token.

      Using that token, as the Bearer token, you can then login.


      ```

      api_key = <TOKEN>

      request_header = {
          'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'
      }

      contacts_url = 'https://api.packetfabric.com/v2/contacts'

      r = requests.get(contacts_url, headers=request_header)

      ```

          automated solutions instead of the user session tokens. Use the response
          of this endpoint wisely, it is the only time you can see the `token`.

          Cloud router connections are not supported yet.


          This is the first step to receive a real-time event stream via

          [Server-sent
          Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).


          In this POST request, you declare which types of events and categories
          of those event

          types you wish to stream. Assuming your request is valid, the response
          will contain a

          `subscription_uuid` that you will use as a path parameter for the
          *Stream Events* `/v2/events/{uuid}`

          endpoint described below.


          Each subscription bundle is permanently associated with the session that
          created it and can

          only be streamed within that session. This includes subscription bundles
          created using API

          Keys (`/v2/api-keys`). Further, you must begin streaming your new
          subscription bundle within

          5 minutes of creation or it will expire. However, once you begin
          streaming a particular

          bundle it will be valid until the session associated with it expires.


          **Make sure to fully expand the schema by clicking `>` to see the
          details for each type of payload.**

          **This is a beta feature.**


          Ensure that you have created a subscription bundle using the *Create
          event subscription* `/v2/events`

          endpoint described above and that you have access to the
          `subscription_uuid` returned from that request.


          Using this `subscription_uuid`, you can now stream events in real-time
          via

          [Server-sent
          Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events)
          from

          `/v2/events/{subscription_uuid}`.


          Every message that you receive will have the same basic structure of an
          `event` field and a

          `data` field. The `data` field will always be a JSON object. The below
          is an example of the

          response you would receive when one of your users authenticates with the
          PacketFabric Portal or API.

          ```

          event: customer|auth

          data: {"log_level": "info","category": "auth","event":
          "login","ip_address": "192.168.1.0","message": "User Hank Aaron logged
          in.","timestamp": "2020-06-11T19:08:10.150711"}


          ```

          The precise content of the `data` of a given message will vary widely
          depending on its particular

          type. The specifics of each are documented below.


          In order to keep the connection open, you will also receive heartbeat
          messages (`:`) if enough

          time has passed between events. Our API enforces a maximum connection
          duration of two hours,

          so any automated system that uses this endpoint will need to account for
          reconnecting periodically.


          The below is a small example client using the
          [sseclient](https://github.com/btubbs/sseclient)

          library for consuming a stream of Server-sent events. To use it, you'll
          need to install sseclient and

          [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/index.html) and be
          using Python 3.7 or later.

          You will need to set your username and password into the `username` and
          `password`

          variables near the bottom of the file as well. Also, the sseclient
          library will automatically

          reconnect when the connection is lost.


          ```

          import asyncio

          import datetime


          import requests

          from sseclient import SSEClient

              print(f"Login response: {resp.json()}")
              return resp.json()["token"]


          def logout(token):
              headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}

              r = SSEClient(url, headers=headers)
              for event in r:
                  print(event.dump())


          if __name__ == "__main__":
              username = ""
              password = ""
              token = login(username, password)
              subscription_uuid = create_subscription(token)

                  print(f"Starting stream at {datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat()}")
                  asyncio.run(consume_client(token, subscription_uuid))
              finally:

        summary: Update a quote
        description: >
          What updates are allowed for a quote is dependent on the status of the
          quote.

          Only `open` and `updating` quotes can have properties other than
          `status` updated.

          - `open` quotes
            - can transition to `cancelled` or `finalized`
            - can have other properties updated
          - `cancelled` quotes
            - cannot transition to any other status
            - no properties can be updated
            - can be duplicated
          - `finalized` quotes
            - can transition to `open` (to update properties or add/delete lines)
            - no other properties can be updated
          - `finalizing` is a state that indicates a background task is running to
          transition the quote from `open` to `finalized`

          - `updating` is a state that indicates a background task is running, but
          the quote can otherwise be considered `open`

                      This is required if the user's email is being changed.

                      This does not change the user's password, for that use PATCH
                      /v2/users/{user_login}/password.
