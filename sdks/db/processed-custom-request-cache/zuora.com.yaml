    # Introduction


    Welcome to the REST API reference for the Zuora Billing, Payments, and
    Central Platform!


    To learn about the common use cases of Zuora REST APIs, check out the [REST
    API Tutorials](https://developer.zuora.com/rest-api/api-guides/overview/).

        
    The Zuora REST API provides a broad set of operations and resources that:

      * Enable Web Storefront integration from your website.
      * Support self-service subscriber sign-ups and account management.
      * Process revenue schedules through custom revenue rule models.
      * Enable manipulation of most objects in the Zuora Billing Object Model.

    target="_blank">Tell us how you feel </a>about using our API and what we can
    do to make it better.


    Some of our older APIs are no longer recommended but still available, not
    affecting any existing integration. To find related API documentation, see
    [Older API
    Reference](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/older-api/overview/).



    # Base URL


    All API requests occur in a test or production environment.  For details on
    Zuora’s environments, see <a
    href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Environments"
    target="_blank">Zuora Environments</a> in the Knowledge Center. 


    Each environment uses a different base URL. Select the appropriate base URL

    # Error Handling


    If a request to Zuora Billing REST API with an endpoint starting with `/v1`
    (except
    [Actions](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/tag/Actions) and
    CRUD operations) fails, the response will contain an eight-digit error code
    with a corresponding error message to indicate the details of the error.


    The following code snippet is a sample error response that contains an error
    code and message pair:


    ```
     {
       "success": false,
       "processId": "CBCFED6580B4E076",
       "reasons":  [
         {
          "code": 53100320,
          "message": "'termType' value should be one of: TERMED, EVERGREEN"
         }
        ]
     }
    ```

    The `success` field indicates whether the API request has succeeded. The
    `processId` field is a Zuora internal ID that you can provide to Zuora
    Global Support for troubleshooting purposes.


    The `reasons` field contains the actual error code and message pair. The
    error code begins with `5` or `6` means that you encountered a certain issue
    that is specific to a REST API resource in Zuora Billing, Payments, and
    Central Platform. For example, `53100320` indicates that an invalid value is
    specified for the `termType` field of the `subscription` object.


    The error code beginning with `9` usually indicates that an
    authentication-related issue occurred, and it can also indicate other
    unexpected errors depending on different cases. For example, `90000011`
    indicates that an invalid credential is provided in the request header. 


    When troubleshooting the error, you can divide the error code into two
    components: REST API resource code and error category code. See the
    following Zuora error code sample:


    <a href="https://developer.zuora.com/images/ZuoraErrorCode.jpeg"
    target="_blank"><img
    src="https://developer.zuora.com/images/ZuoraErrorCode.jpeg" alt="Zuora
    Error Code Sample"></a>



    **Note:** Zuora determines resource codes based on the request payload.
    Therefore, if GET and DELETE requests that do not contain payloads fail, you
    will get `500000` as the resource code, which indicates an unknown object
    and an unknown field. 

    The error category code of these requests is valid and follows the rules
    described in the [Error Category
    Codes](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/overview/#section/Error-Handling/Error-Category-Codes)
    section. 

    In such case, you can refer to the returned error message to troubleshoot.



    ## REST API Resource Codes


    The 6-digit resource code indicates the REST API resource, typically a field
    of a Zuora object, on which the issue occurs. In the preceding example,
    `531003` refers to the `termType` field of the `subscription` object. 


    The value range for all REST API resource codes is from `500000` to
    `679999`. See <a
    href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/API/AA_REST_API/Resource_Codes"
    target="_blank">Resource Codes</a> in the Knowledge Center for a full list
    of resource codes.


    ## Error Category Codes


    The 2-digit error category code identifies the type of error, for example,
    resource not found or missing required field. 


    The following table describes all error categories and the corresponding
    resolution:


    | Code    | Error category              | Description    | Resolution    |

    |:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------|

    | 10      | Permission or access denied | The request cannot be processed
    because a certain tenant or user permission is missing. | Check the missing

    | 30      | Rule restriction            | The request cannot be processed
    due to the violation of a Zuora business rule. | Check the response message
    and ensure that the API request meets the specified business rules. |

    | 40      | Not found                   | The specified resource cannot be
    found. | Check the response message and ensure that the specified resource
    exists in your Zuora tenant. |

    | 45      | Unsupported request         | The requested endpoint does not
    support the specified HTTP method. | Check your request and ensure that the
    endpoint and method matches. |

    | 50      | Locking contention          | This request cannot be processed
    because the objects this request is trying to modify are being modified by
    another API request, UI operation, or batch job process. | <p>Resubmit the
    request first to have another try.</p> <p>If this error still occurs,
    contact <a href="https://support.zuora.com" target="_blank">Zuora Global
    Support</a> with the returned `Zuora-Request-Id` value in the response
    header for assistance.</p> |

    | 70      | Request exceeded limit      | The total number of concurrent
    requests exceeds the limit allowed by the system. | <p>Resubmit the request
    after the number of seconds specified by the `Retry-After` value in the
    response header.</p> <p>Check [Concurrent request
    limits](https://developer.zuora.com/rest-api/general-concepts/rate-concurrency-limits/)
    for details about Zuora’s concurrent request limit policy.</p> |

    | 90      | Malformed request           | The request cannot be processed
    due to JSON syntax errors. | Check the syntax error in the JSON request body
    and ensure that the request is in the correct JSON format. |

    | 99      | Integration error           | The server encounters an error
    when communicating with an external system, for example, payment gateway,
    tax engine provider. | Check the response message and take action
    accordingly. |



    # API Versions


    The Zuora REST API are version controlled. Versioning ensures that Zuora
    REST API changes are backward compatible. Zuora uses a major and minor
    version nomenclature to manage changes. By specifying a version in a REST
    request, you can get expected responses regardless of future changes to the
    API.


    ## Major Version


    The major version number of the REST API appears in the REST URL. In this
    API reference, only the **v1** major version is available. For example,
    `POST https://rest.zuora.com/v1/subscriptions`.


    ## Minor Version


    Zuora uses minor versions for the REST API to control small changes. For
    example, a field in a REST method is deprecated and a new field is used to
    replace it. 


    Some fields in the REST methods are supported as of minor versions. If a
    field is not noted with a minor version, this field is available for all
    minor versions. If a field is noted with a minor version, this field is in
    version control. You must specify the supported minor version in the request
    header to process without an error. 


    If a field is in version control, it is either with a minimum minor version
    or a maximum minor version, or both of them. You can only use this field
    with the minor version between the minimum and the maximum minor versions.
    For example, the `invoiceCollect` field in the POST Subscription method is
    in version control and its maximum minor version is 189.0. You can only use
    this field with the minor version 189.0 or earlier.


    If you specify a version number in the request header that is not supported,
    Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API. In our REST API
    documentation, if a field or feature requires a minor version number, we
    note that in the field description.


    You only need to specify the version number when you use the fields require
    a minor version. To specify the minor version, set the `zuora-version`
    parameter to the minor version number in the request header for the request
    call. For example, the `collect` field is in 196.0 minor version. If you
    want to use this field for the POST Subscription method, set the 
    `zuora-version` parameter to `196.0` in the request header. The
    `zuora-version` parameter is case sensitive.


    For all the REST API fields, by default, if the minor version is not
    specified in the request header, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of
    the REST API to avoid breaking your integration. 


    ### Minor Version History


    The supported minor versions are not consecutive. 

    You can use the following versions to override the default version
    (`186.0`):
      - 187.0
      - 188.0
      - 189.0
      - 196.0
      - 206.0
      - 207.0
      - 211.0
      - 214.0
      - 215.0
      - 216.0
      - 223.0
      - 224.0
      - 230.0
      - 239.0
      - 256.0
      - 257.0
      - 309.0
      - 314.0
      - 315.0
      - 329.0
      - 330.0
      - 336.0
      - 337.0
      - 338.0
      - 341.0

    If you set the `zuora-version` header to a version excluded from the
    preceding list, the corresponding API request is processed as you use the
    default version, `186.0`.


    The following table lists the supported versions and the fields that have a
    Zuora REST API minor version.
