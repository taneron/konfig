      # Introduction


      This document contains the official documentation for the latest version of
      the Verifiable API. Our solution has been built API-first. That means we
      first design our API's and build our own user interfaces on top of these
      API's afterwards. This results in a reusable API that can be used by 3rd
      parties to offer the exact same functionality as we can provide ourselves.
      Both the product and API are still subject to significant and potentially
      breaking changes, so please refer back to this documentation frequently. Any
      breaking change will be communicated ahead of time to our partners
      integrating with our API's.


      # Getting Started


      This is a RESTful API that can be accessed using convential HTTP methods. It
      doesn't matter what programming language you use, there is already tooling
      available that can jumpstart you to access our API's. This documentation is
      based on OpenAPI 3.0 specifications and as such it is possible to
      dynamically generate a client in a language of your choice by simply loading
      our [specification
      document](https://api.discovery.verifiable.com/.well-known/openapi/vCurrent.json)
      in a tool such as [Swagger
      Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/). It is not necessary to
      generate such a client and it is also possible to simply use any HTTP client
      to access our API. You can refer to the reference below to find the correct
      HTTP method, endpoint and model to use.


      ### Environments


      When developing an integration with our API we typicially request you to use
      our `staging` environment for development and only start using `production`
      when your integration is stable and tested thoroughly. Please contact
      [Verifiable support](https://verifiable.com/contact) to be granted access to
      our environments.


      **Staging Base URL**

      ```

      https://api.discovery-staging.verifiable.com/

      ```


      **Production Base URL**

      ```

      https://api.discovery.verifiable.com/

      ```


      ## Authentication


      Most endpoints require authentication to be used. You can authenticate to
      the API by passing an access token in the `Authentication` header using the
      `Bearer` scheme. An access token can be requested by authenticating against
      one of the [Authentication endpoints](https://api.discovery.verifiable.com).


      ### Example using password authentication endpoint


      **Request:**


      ```http

      POST /auth/token/password HTTP/1.1

      Content-Type: application/json

      Host: https://<SERVER>

      {
          "email": "john.doe@mail.com",
          "password": "secret"
      }

      ```


      **Response:**


      ```http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK

      Date: Fri, 25 Sep 2020 12:59:56 GMT

      Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

      {
          "tokenId": "2e5db76c-4c48-4cce-b11f-23a57ac5824c",
          "token": "MtetyFcIW...xgXXX-Z4yy"
      }

      ```


      ### Example using access token


      **Request**


      ```http

      GET /audit/log HTTP/1.1

      Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>

      Host: https://<SERVER>

      ```


      An access token is bound to a single user in an organization. The access
      token should remain secret and be treated as if it were a password. We
      recommend you to create access tokens with a short time to live and
      frequently rotate them. Note that time to live requested might be lowered to
      a shorter duration based on your organization settings. These can be
      configured to enforce a suitable maximum time to live for your use-cases
      that facilitate users and service integrations.


      ## Create a new provider


      A provider must be created and associated with license numbers, NPI numbers
      or other identifiers that can be used to perform lookups to fetch associated
      data for this provider.


      ### Example creating a new provider


      To create a new provider that can be used for license lookups:


      **Request:**


      ```http

      POST /providers HTTP/1.1

      Content-Type: application/json

      Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>

      Host: https://<SERVER>

      {
          "firstName": "John",
          "lastName": "Doe"
      }

      ```


      **Response:**


      ```http

      HTTP/1.1 201 Created

      Date: Fri, 25 Sep 2020 15:25:12 GMT

      Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

      Location: https://<SERVER>/providers/9706f2ea-9c1d-49f3-9a57-871159878c9c

      {
          "firstName": "John",
          "lastName": "Doe",
          "id": "9706f2ea-9c1d-49f3-9a57-871159878c9c",
          "licenses": []
      }

      ```


      **Note:**

      The `id` in the response is the `Provider id`. It can be used as a `Path
      Parameter` to add the licenses to the provider, using Attach license API.

      Also you need `licenseTypeId` which can be picked from the [List License
      Types](https://api.discovery.verifiable.com) API, we will handle this next.
      For more details on providers see [Provider
      endpoints](https://api.discovery.verifiable.com)


      ## Get license types


      The list of license types which are supported for license verification.


      ### Example get license types


      Returns a list of all license types that are currently supported and used
      for license verifications.


      **Request**


      ```http

      GET /licensetypes HTTP/1.1

      Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>

      Host: https://<SERVER>

      ```


      **Response:**


      ```http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK

      Date: Fri, 25 Sep 2020 15:32:47 GMT

      Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

      {
          "nextOffset": "100",
          "nextCursor": "100",
          "pageSize": 100,
          "items": [
              {
                  "id": "0059f76a-280a-377a-73e2-ddfe86f4113c",
                  "name": "Medical Physician & Surgeon",
                  "source": {
                      "id": "72dcec62-a0d3-4af8-955d-07ecac8f1e4d",
                      "name": "Missouri Division of ProfessionalRegistration",
                      "state": "MO",
                      "availability": "Available",
                      "isDegraded": false,
                      "url": "https://pr.mo.gov/licensee-search.asp"
                  }
              },
          ],
          "sortedBy": "Id",
          "sortDirection": "Asc"
      }

      ```


      **Note:**

      `id` in response refers to `licenseTypeId`. It will be unique for each
      license type. Please see [List License
      Types](https://api.discovery.verifiable.com) for more details.


      ## Attach a license to a provider


      To perform a license verification you must attach a license to a provider.
      The first time you do this will automatically trigger a license verification
      on that provider. Once attached you can re-verify the same license without
      reattaching it. A provider can have more than one license attached.


      ### Example attach license to a provider


      **Request:**


      ```http

      POST /providers/{providerId}/licenses HTTP/1.1

      Content-Type: application/json

      Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>

      Host: https://<SERVER>

      {
          "licenseNumber": "123456",
          "licenseTypeId": "0059f76a-280a-377a-73e2-ddfe86f4113c"
      }

      ```


      **Response:**


      ```http

      HTTP/1.1 201 Created

      Date: Fri, 25 Sep 2020 15:35:00 GMT

      Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

          "licenseNumber": "123456",
          "licenseType": {
              "id": "0059f76a-280a-377a-73e2-ddfe86f4113c",
              "name": "Registered Nurse - RN",
              "source": {
                  "id": "679b4f9a-cc3c-49e8-b560-0d0a9af47fd3”,

          "id": "b45cbeb0-873e-495b-8182-1b9a8b6d379d"
      }

      ```


      **Note:**

      Register a Webhook to get notified on HTTP endpoint, this prevents the need
      to poll the API for completion checks. For more details on Webhooks please
      see [Webhooks endpoint](https://api.discovery.verifiable.com) and for
      details on attaching a license see [Attach License
      endpoint](https://api.discovery.verifiable.com).


      ## Fetch created provider

      ### Example to fetch created provider


      **Request**


      ```http

      GET /providers/{providerId} HTTP/1.1

      Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>

      Host: https://<SERVER>

      ```


      **Response:**

              }
          ]
      }

      ```


      **Note:**

      Response contains attached licenses, NPI details for the given provider. To
      get details of these individual items (a particular License or an NPI), use
      unique identifiers in each of these categories. For more details check [Get
      specific license endpoint](https://api.discovery.verifiable.com) or [Get
      specific NPI record](https://api.discovery.verifiable.com). Further details
      on providers are at [Providers
      endpoint](https://api.discovery.verifiable.com).


      # Common Concepts


      ## Pagination, filtering and sorting


      Some endpoints can return a large list of data. To allow you to efficiently
      iterate through this data these endpoints offer pagination, sorting and
      filtering. The concept will be similar for each endpoint that supports it:


      * Pagination, filtering and sorting parameters are provided through the
      query string.

      * Pagination, filtering and sorting is only supported for endpoints that
      return lists of data.

      * Filters is only supported for certain endpoints. You can refer to the
      documentation of the endpoint to find out if filtering is supported.

      * The `sortedBy` and `sortDirection` parameters can be used to specify the
      sorting method.

      * The `count` parameter can be used to specify the page size. Please note
      that the maximum and default page size can differ per endpoint.

      * (Deprecated) The `offset` parameter influences the start of the page. For
      the first page you can always omit this parameter. For any subsequent page
      you can supply the value from the `nextOffset` parameter as returned by the
      server.

      * The `cursor` parameter influences the start of the page. For the first
      page you can always omit this parameter. For any subsequent page you can
      supply the value from the `nextCursor` or `previousCursor` parameter as
      returned by the server.


      Example on how to make a paginated request:


      ```http

      GET /audit/log?sortDirection=Asc&sortedBy=Id&count=10 HTTP/1.1

      Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>

      Host: https://<SERVER>

      ```


      In addition to returning a list of `items`, a paginated response will also
      return `nextCursor` and/or `previousCursor`. The value of this property can
      be used to fetch the next or previous page by passing it in the `cursor`
      parameter.


      ## Error handling


      All responses that do not indicate a success status code will return an
      error using the error model as specified by [RFC
      7807](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807). The amount of details exposed by
      the error model varies and depends on the nature of the error. We attempt to
      include as much information as is necessary to be able to self-diagnose the
      problem that led to the error. Should this information not be enough, then
      we also supply a `correlationId` in the response. We kindly request you to
      make note of this value when contacting Verifiable support as this will help
      us to quickly locate more information on this error.


      Example error result on a malformed request:

      ```json

      {
          "type": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1",
          "title": "One or more validation errors occurred.",
          "status": 400,
          "correlationId": "5e94110e-45a8-404c-831d-77eaeaa73ad6",
          "errors": {
              "$.firstName": [
                  "The JSON value could not be converted to System.String. Path: $.firstName | LineNumber: 1 | BytePositionInLine: 18."
              ]
          }
      }

      ```


      ## Nullable properties


      If an input parameter is required it is marked as such. If an input
      parameter is not marked as required and you do not wish or need to use it,
      you should omit the parameter completely in the request.


      For response parameters you should always code defensively and assume that a
      parameter might be missing from the response. This could happen in case the
      parameter is not applicable (yet) or simply because the data is missing. By
      coding defensively and assuming that a parameter might be missing you also
      future proof your solution for potential future (otherwise) breaking
      changes.


      ## Flexible data model


      In some cases we collect data from external sources that are hard to fit in
      a single predefined schema. For these cases we have come up with a flexible
      data model that allows us to store structured data in 3 different ways:
       - Form 
       - Table 
       - Section
       
      ### Table


      Data that can be represented in a table structure. The keys of every
      element/object in the data array is expected to be the same.


      ```json

      {
         "type": "Table",
         "data": [
            {
               "Status Code": "CB",
               "Effective Date": "06/10/2016",
               "Description": "CANCELLED BY BOARD"
            },
            {
               "Status Code": "NA",
               "Effective Date": "06/10/2016",
               "Description": "NOT ACTIVE"
            }
         ]
      }

      ```


      ### Section

      Sections are used to represent multiple different data representations. For
      example, additional properties can 

      have three sections with section one being a Form, while the other two could
      be a table. 

      Also note there could be sections with and without heading.


      #### With section heading

      ```json

      {
         "type": "Section",
         "data": {
            "Discipline": {
               "type": "Form",
               "data": {
                  "Discipline/Final Orders state": "ILLINOIS",
                  "Date action was taken": "02/03/2020",
                  "Against privilege to practice (PTP)": "N/A"
               }
            },
            "NPDB code": {
               "type": "Form",
               "data": {
                  "NPDB code": "39 - LICENSE REVOCATION, SUSPENSION OR OTHER DISCIPLINARY ACTION TAKEN BY A FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LICENSING AUTHORITY"
               }
            },
            "Actions": {
               "type": "Form",
               "data": {
                  "Initial action date": "02/03/2020",
                  "Effective date(s)": "02/03/2020 - INDEFINITE/UNSPECIFIED",
                  "Is license automatically reinstated after the effective date(s)": "NOT SUPPLIED",
                  "NPDB code": "1148 - DENIAL OF LICENSE RENEWAL"
               }
            }
         }
      }

      ```


      #### Without section heading

      ```json

      {
         "type": "Section",
         "data": [
            {
               "type": "Form",
               "data": {
                  "Discipline/Final Orders state": "ILLINOIS",
                  "Date action was taken": "02/03/2020",
                  "Against privilege to practice (PTP)": "N/A"
               }
            },
            {

      ### Form


      A form is essentially a simple key/value collection, but it can also have
      nested flexible data.


      #### Simple form

      ```json

      {
         "type": "Form",
         "data": {
            "Date of Birth": "1958",
            "Registration Date": "06/13/2016",
            "Disciplinary Status": "CANCELLED BY BOARD"
         }
      }

      ```


      #### Nested form


      ```json

      {
         "type": "Form",
         "data": {
            "Date of Birth": "1958",
            "Registration Date": "06/13/2016",
            "Disciplinary Status": "CANCELLED BY BOARD",
            "Status Change": {
               "type": "Table",
               "data": [
                  {
                     "Status Code": "CB",
                     "Effective Date": "06/10/2016",
                     "Description": "CANCELLED BY BOARD"
                  },
                  {
                     "Status Code": "NA",
                     "Effective Date": "06/10/2016",
                     "Description": "NOT ACTIVE"
                  }
               ]
            }
         }
      }

      ```

          Endpoint for authentication using an email and password for a user
          already registered at Verifiable. In return you will receive an access
          token that can be used in the following API calls.


          **Note:** The account may require a password change for successful
          authentication. If password change is required and `newPassword` is not
          set the server returns `409 Conflict`.

          If `newPassword` is set but the current `password` is not correct the
          server returns `403 Forbidden`.


          **Note:** If `newPassword` is set it *must* be different than the
          current password. If the password is the same the server returns `400
          Bad Request`.


          **Note:** When `newPassword` is set and the request returns `200 Ok`,
          all the active access tokens will be invalidated.

          After a license verification is executed we sometimes are uncertain
          about the results we get from the source. For example when the source
          returns more than 1 match or the name of the license does not match the
          name that was used for the provider. In such cases we mark the license
          `status` as `NeedsReview`. It is expected that this status is resolved

          Attach a license to a provider
        description: >
          To perform a license verification you must first attach a license to a
          provider. The first time you do this will automatically trigger a
          license verification on that provider. Once attached you can reverify
          the same license without reattaching it. A provider can have more than
          one license attached.

      description: >
        These endpoints let you import a provider’s profile data from different
        sources (such as a provider’s National Provider Identifier (NPI) record).
        This allows you to build a more complete picture of a provider within
        Verifiable and gives you easy access to the latest provider profile data
        across multiple sources. 


        In order to import an external profile, each source has its own list of
        required parameters. A provider must first have the required data in their
        Verifiable profile before you can run an import.


        Once a request is created, fetching a profile is fast and typically takes
        seconds to return. You can check the status of an import request using the
        "Get an existing provider profile import" endpoint.

    - name: Licenses
      description: >
        These endpoints allow you to add licenses to a provider and perform
        license lookups. Please note that a license lookup may take some time
        depending on the load and performance of the external data source. It is
        generally recommended to wait at least 2 seconds before polling for an
        update or use one of the notification mechanisms we provide (TBD).


        License verification result will have the basic information about the
        license such as license number, licenseType, status, issued date, expiry
        date, etc. In addition, the disciplinary actions and other additional
        information that is captured from the source site is represented through
        the disciplinaryActions and additionalProperties fields. The disciplinary
        actions and additional properties fields describe the type of data that is

        scan is asynchronous, but most scans will result in near immediate
        completion. A webhook of type
        [DatasetScanCompleted](/reference/tag/Webhook-Callbacks/#tag/Webhook-Callbacks/section/DatasetScanCompleted)

    - name: Webhooks
      description: >
        Endpoints to allow you to create and manage webhooks that will be called
        when a special event occurs. On this special event Verifiable will attempt
        to make an HTTP POST to the URL specified in the webhook. The payload of
        this request can vary, depending on the `type`. The `type` is included in
        the `X-WebhookType` header. This allows you to register multiple webhooks
        on the same endpoint and still be able to distinguish the webhook types.
        The webhook dispatcher expects the remote server to return an HTTP success
        status code. If it cannot be delivered, it will retry the callback a
        maximum of 10 times with a 30 second interval.


        By default we do not allow you to use insecure URLs for callbacks. You can
        optionally create a webhook that allows insecure URLs for testing
        purposes. We recommend you to use an HTTPS callback with a valid SSL
        certificate so that the integrity of the callback is ensured. For added
        security we will pass the webhook id (which is only known to the creator)
        in the `X-WebhookId` header and we will pass an optional secret in the
        `X-Secret` header.


        To be able to uniquely track webhook messages we also include the
        `X-TraceId` header. This will contain a unique value that doesn't change
        for every attempt we make to send a specific message. You can use this to
        keep a log of all messages that you have successfully processed.


        You can refer to [Webhook Callbacks](https://api.discovery.verifiable.com)
        to find the model that is included in the payload of the HTTP request to
        the callback URL.

    - name: CredentialingRequests
      description: >
        These endpoints allow you to create and get credentialing requests. A
        credentialing request is a workflow that supports

        the creation of a credentialing packet. You can create a request for
        Verifiable's NCQA-certified CVO services to process

        or you can choose to self manage the workflow. By default, a CVO
        credentialing request will be created unless self

        managed is specified. Once a request has been created you cannot change
        between self managed and CVO. Multiple

        credentialing events can be created and managed for a provider.


        When a CVO credentialing request is created, the request will be sent
        directly to the Verifiable CVO team to begin

        processing. You can check the status of the request by querying

        the [GetCredentialingRequest](https://api.discovery.verifiable.com)

        or [ListCredentialingRequests](https://api.discovery.verifiable.com)
        operations.


        To keep track of the request, events are created to manage each stage of
        the credentialing request process using

        the
        [CreateCredentialingRequestEvent](https://api.discovery.verifiable.com)
        operation. You can also fetch specific

        events using the

        operation.
