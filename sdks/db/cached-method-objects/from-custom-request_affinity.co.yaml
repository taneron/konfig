  # Introduction


  Welcome to Affinity API v2! This API provides a RESTful interface for building
  internal apps,

  automated workflows, and other integrations on top of the core data models in
  Affinity, and for

  connecting Affinity to the rest of your tech and data stack.


  Please note that this new version of the API is not at feature parity with

  [Affinity API v1](https://api-docs.affinity.co/). We will add to this new
  version to cover more of

  v1's functionality over time. **This API version is also only available on
  select Affinity license

  types.** See

  [this Help Center
  article](https://support.affinity.co/hc/en-us/articles/5563700459533-Getting-started-with-the-Affinity-API-FAQs)

  or contact your Customer Success Manager for more information.


  # Getting Started


  All Affinity API endpoints use the base URL `https://api.affinity.co`. All v2
  endpoint paths start

  with `/v2`. Requests must be sent over HTTPS.


  ## Using These Docs


  The first few sections of these docs cover general information on the API.
  Each subsequent section

  covers a set of API endpoints.


  Each endpoint is documented with its accepted request parameters, expected
  response shapes, and a

  sample request and response. Please note that the shape of a given response
  can vary depending on

  what "type" of object or data is being returned. When this is the case, the
  response documentation

  will include a dropdown that can be used to select the "type" for which to
  display the response

  shape.


  ## Authentication


  Affinity API v2 uses API keys and **bearer authentication** (this is an
  important difference from

  Affinity API v1's use of basic authentication).


  To generate an API key, navigate to the Settings page in the Affinity web app.
  You will need the

  "Generate an API key" role-based permission controlled by your Affinity admin
  to be able to do this.

  See

  [this Help Center
  article](https://support.affinity.co/hc/en-us/articles/360032633992-How-to-obtain-your-API-Key)

  for full instructions on API key generation, and

  [this
  article](https://support.affinity.co/hc/en-us/articles/360015976732-Account-Level-Permissions)

  for more information on role-based permissions in Affinity.


  Currently, we support one API key per user in your Affinity account. Your API
  key is able to read

  data and perform actions in Affinity on your behalf, so keep it safe as you
  would a password.


  Provide your API key as your bearer authentication token to start making calls
  to Affinity API v2.


  ## Permissions


  ### Overall requirements


  You must have the "Generate an API key" permission to be able to work with the
  Affinity API. Most

  users in most Affinity accounts with API access have this by default — Contact
  your Affinity admin

  if you are not able to generate an API key, and see

  [this
  article](https://support.affinity.co/hc/en-us/articles/360015976732-Account-Level-Permissions)

  for more information on role-based permissions in Affinity.


  ### Resource-level permissions


  The Affinity API respects sharing permissions that are set in-product. For
  example, if a given user

  does not have access to a list, note, or interaction in-product, they will not
  be able to see or

  modify it via API.


  ### Endpoint-level permissions


  Many API endpoints also require endpoint-specific permissions that map to
  permissions in-product.

  These permissions, along with the "Generate an API key" permission, are
  managed by your Affinity

  admin in the Settings page:


  | API v2 Endpoint                                            | Required
  Permission                  |

  | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
  ------------------------------------ |

  | GET `/v2/companies`                                        | "Export All
  Organizations directory" |

  | GET `/v2/companies/{id}`                                   | "Export All
  Organizations directory" |

  | GET `/v2/companies/{id}/list-entries`                      | "Export data
  from Lists"             |

  | GET `/v2/persons`                                          | "Export All
  People directory"        |

  | GET `/v2/persons/{id}`                                     | "Export All
  People directory"        |

  | GET `/v2/persons/{id}/list-entries`                        | "Export data
  from Lists"             |

  | GET `/v2/opportunities`                                    | "Export data
  from Lists"             |

  | GET `/v2/opportunities/{id}`                               | "Export data
  from Lists"             |

  | GET `/v2/lists/{listId}/list-entries`                      | "Export data
  from Lists"             |

  | GET `/v2/lists/{listId}/saved-views/{viewId}/list-entries` | "Export data
  from Lists"             |


  ## Rate Limits


  The Affinity API sets a limit on the number of calls that a user can make per
  minute, and that all

  the users on an account can make per month. It also sets a reasonable limit on
  the number of

  concurrent requests it will support from an account at one time.


  Requests to **both** Affinity API versions will count toward the one pool of
  requests allowed for a

  user or account. Once a per-minute, monthly, or concurrent rate limit is hit,
  subsequent requests

  will return an error code of 429. **We highly recommend designing your
  application to handle 429

  errors.**


  ### Per-Minute Limits (User-Level)


  To help protect our systems, API requests will be halted at **900 per user,
  per minute.** We may

  also lower this limit on a temporary basis to manage API availability.


  ### Concurrent Request Limits (Account-Level)


  To protect our systems and manage availability across customers, we set a
  reasonable limit on

  concurrent requests at the account level. Customers should not expect to hit
  this limit unless they

  are hitting the API with heavy operations from many concurrent threads at
  once.


  ### Monthly Plan Tier Limits (Account-Level)


  The overall number of requests you can make per month will depend on your
  account's plan tier.

  **This monthly account-level limit resets at the end of each calendar month.**
  Current rate limits

  by plan tier are:


  | Plan Tier  | Calls Per Month |

  | ---------- | --------------- |

  | Essentials | None            |

  | Scale      | 100k            |

  | Advanced   | 100k            |

  | Enterprise | Unlimited\*     |


  \*Per-Minute and Concurrent Request Limits still apply.


  ### Rate Limit Headers


  All API calls will return the following response headers with information

  ## Pagination


  When an endpoint is expected to return multiple results, we break the results
  up into pages to make

  them easier to handle. To cycle forward through multiple pages of data, look
  for the `nextUrl`

  property in the `pagination` portion of an API response, and use it for your
  next request. See

  endpoint documentation for more information.


  ## Error Codes


  Here is a list of the error codes this API will generally return if something
  goes wrong (see

  endpoint documentation for endpoint-specific error information):

  # Data Model


  ## The Basics


  - The three top-level objects in Affinity are **Persons, Companies, and
  Opportunities**. (Please
    note: Companies are called Organizations in the Affinity web app.) These have profiles in the
    Affinity web app and can be added to Lists.
  - A lot of the work of Affinity happens within Lists. A **List** is a
  spreadsheet-like collection of
    rows tied to Persons, Companies, or Opportunities.
  - Each row on a List is a **List Entry**. A List Entry contains data and
  metadata about a given
    Person, Company, or Opportunity in the context of a List. This includes list-specific field data,
    and information about who added the row to the List and when.
    - Do note that a given entity can be added to a List more than once, i.e., it can have multiple
      List Entries on the same List. These List Entries can have different list-specific field data
      and List Entry-level metadata.
  - Each column on a List maps to a **Field**. Fields and field data also show
  up within Affinity
    profile pages, extensions, and integrations.
    - Some Fields are scoped to a single List — These are **list-specific fields**, and in the API,
      their data can only be accessed through the List Entry resource. "Global" data from other Fields
      can be accessed both through the Person/Company/Opportunity resource and the List Entry
      resource.

  ## Working with Field Data


  ### Field Types and IDs


  There are a few types of Fields in Affinity, differentiated by the scope and
  source of their data:


  | Field&nbsp;Type             |
  Description                                                                                                                                                 
  | Example
  Fields                                                                                                                                             
  | Field ID
  Pattern                                                                                                                            
  |

  | --------------------------- |
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |

  | `enriched`                  | Firmographic, funding, and people Fields
  populated by Affinity. These can be "Affinity Data" Fields or come from
  distinct data partners.                     | "Affinity Data: Description",
  "Dealroom: Number of
  Employees"                                                                                              
  | A string representing the enrichment source, followed by the field name,
  e.g. `affinity-data-description` or `dealroom-number-of-employees`. |

  | `list`                      | Fields that are specific to the context of a
  given list. These can only be accessed through `*/list-entries` endpoints in
  this version of the API.           | Default "Status" and "Amount" columns,
  custom columns that pertain to a given List of deals or
  founders                                                     | `field-`,
  followed by a unique integer, e.g.
  `field-1234`                                                                                   
  |

  | `global`                    | Fields that persist across an Affinity account
  and are not
  list-specific.                                                                                   
  | "My Firm's Founder Scoring
  Column"                                                                                                                         
  | `field-`, followed by a unique integer, e.g.
  `field-1234`                                                                                   
  |

  | `relationship-intelligence` | Fields populated by Affinity from users' email
  and calendar data that provide insight into your firm's relationship with a
  given Person/Company/Opportunity. | "Source of Introduction", "First Email",
  "Last Email", "First Event", "Last Event", "Next Event", "First Chat Message",
  "Last Chat Message", "Last Contact" | A string similar to the field's name
  in-product, e.g.
  `source-of-introduction`                                                              
  |


  ### Field Value Types


  Field data can take a variety of shapes. These value types are described in
  the Affinity Help Center

  [here](https://support.affinity.co/hc/en-us/articles/115001608232-How-to-create-a-new-column-in-a-list).

  Here is a list of the same value types, as represented in this API. Notice how
  array types end with

  `-multi`:


  | Single Type         | Array Type                |

  | ------------------- | ------------------------- |

  | `text`              | Not supported in Affinity |

  | `number`            | `number-multi`            |

  | `datetime`          | Not supported in Affinity |

  | `location`          | `location-multi`          |

  | `dropdown`          | `dropdown-multi`          |

  | `ranked-dropdown`   | Not supported in Affinity |

  | `person`            | `person-multi`            |

  | `company`           | `company-multi`           |

  | `filterable-text`\* | `filterable-text-multi`\* |


  \*Please note that `filterable-text` and `filterable-text-multi` are special
  types that operate

  similarly to `dropdown` and `dropdown-multi`. They are reserved for
  Affinity-populated Fields, and

  users cannot create Fields with these types.


  When an array-typed value has no data in it, the API will return `null`
  (rather than an empty

  array).


  ### Retrieving Field Data


  To retrieve field data on companies, persons, or opportunities, call GET
  `/v2/companies`, GET

  `/v2/persons`, or one of our GET `*/list-entries` endpoints. (Note that
  Opportunities only have

  list-specific Fields, so all their field data will live on the
  `*/list-entries` endpoints.) For most

  of these endpoints, you will need to specify the Fields for which you want
  data returned via the

  `fieldIds` or `fieldTypes` parameter — Otherwise, entities will be returned
  without any field data

  attached.


  The GET `/v2/companies` and `/v2/persons` endpoints can return entities with
  enriched, global, and

  relationship intelligence field data attached, but do not support
  list-specific field data. **To get

  comprehensive field data including list-specific field data on Companies and
  Persons, use the GET

  `*/list-entries` endpoints.**


  ### Specifying Desired Fields (Field Selection)


  As mentioned above, you will need to specify the Fields (either by ID or by
  Type) for which you want

  data returned when using the following endpoints:


  - GET `/v2/companies`

  - GET `/v2/companies/{id}`

  - GET `/v2/persons`

  - GET `/v2/persons/{id}`

  - GET `/v2/lists/{listId}/list-entries`


  Each of these endpoints has a `fieldIds` parameter that accepts an array of
  Field IDs, and a

  `fieldTypes` parameter that accepts an array of Field Types. Use the GET
  `*/fields` endpoints to get

  Field IDs, Field Types, and other Field-level metadata:


  - Call GET `/v2/companies/fields` and `/v2/persons/fields` to get a list of
  the enriched, global,
    and relationship intelligence (AKA non-list-specific) Fields that exist on Companies and Persons,
    respectively. These are the Fields whose values are available to pull via GET `/v2/companies`, GET
    `/v2/companies/{id}`, GET `/v2/persons`, and `/v2/persons/{id}`.

  - Call GET `/v2/lists/{listId}/fields` to get a list of the enriched, global,
  relationship
    intelligence, **and list-specific** Fields for a given List. These are the Fields whose values are
    available to pull via GET `/v2/lists/{listId}/list-entries`.

  The following endpoints don't require field selection:


  - GET `/v2/lists/{listId}/saved-views/{viewId}/list-entries` — See below. This
  endpoint returns just
    the field data that has been pulled into the given Saved View via UI.
  - GET `/v2/companies/{id}/list-entries` and GET
  `/v2/persons/{id}/list-entries` — These endpoints
    return comprehensive field data for the given person or company in the context of each List Entry.

  ### Saved Views


  A Saved View allows a user to configure the Fields they want to see in the UI
  for a given List, and

  set filters and sorts on the rows on that List. A List can have multiple Saved
  Views. In the context

  of this API, Saved Views can be useful for specifying the exact Fields for
  which data is needed. The

  `*/saved-views/{viewId}/list-entries` endpoint also respects the filters that
  have been set on the

  given Saved View in the Affinity web app. (It does not, however, respect sorts
  just yet.)


  ### Partner Data Restrictions


  This API supports pulling data from

  [Affinity
  Data](https://support.affinity.co/hc/en-us/articles/360058255052-Affinity-Data)
  fields and

  select

  [Dealroom
  fields](https://support.affinity.co/hc/en-us/articles/6106558518797-Dealroom-co-data-in-Affinity#h_01G2N22SVH7TJR3DJV3NQDE9HQ).

  Due the agreements we have with some of our data partners, the API does not
  expose data from the

  following sources:


  - Crunchbase, including Crunchbase UUID

  - Pitchbook

  - [Dealroom "exclusive"
  fields](https://support.affinity.co/hc/en-us/articles/6106558518797-Dealroom-co-data-in-Affinity#h_01G2N22YEAZJ5TC1X9ENKZFWF5)


  ## A Note on Nested Associations


  Some GET endpoints return "association" data under `fields`. For example, the
  Persons GET endpoints

  return data about which Companies a Person is associated with in Affinity. The
  Opportunities GET

  endpoints return similar data about associated Companies and Persons. The List
  Entries GET endpoints

  also return this data for Person and Opportunity List Entries.


  The API truncates these nested arrays of Persons or Companies **at 100
  entries**. For example, if an

  Opportunity is associated with 200 Persons in Affinity, only 100 of those
  Persons will be returned

  by the GET `/opportunities` or `/opportunities/{id}` endpoint.

  # Changelog


  ## March 25, 2024


  - Added the ability to retrieve the date and other details of your firm's
  "First Email", "Last
    Email", "First Event", "Last Event", "Next Event", "First Chat Message", "Last Chat Message", and
    "Last Contact" with a given entity. Use these timestamps to add relationship context to your
    applications, and to identify founders and companies that need investors' attention.
  - Endpoints that previously required a `fieldIds` parameter to return field
  data, now accept either
    `fieldIds` or `fieldTypes`, and will return field data accordingly. See the
    [Specifying Desired Fields (Field Selection)](https://developer.affinity.co/) section
    of these docs for more information. The new `fieldTypes` parameter should make field data
    retrieval easier for users looking to pull data from many similar Fields at a time.

  ## January 4, 2023


  - Most endpoints that return field data now require the user to use the
  `fieldIds` parameter to
    specify which Fields they want data for. Without `fieldIds` specified, these endpoints will return
    basic entity data but not field data.

  ## December 12, 2023


  - Added the ability to retrieve metadata (e.g. ID, name, type, enrichment
  source, and data type) on
    Fields. See the [Retrieving Field Metadata](https://developer.affinity.co/) section
    of these docs for more information.
