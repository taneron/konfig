  "apiDescription": "The Browse API has the following resources: item_summary: Lets shoppers search for specific items by keyword, GTIN, category, charity, product, or item aspects and refine the results by using filters, such as aspects, compatibility, and fields values. &nbsp;(Experimental) search_by_image: Lets shoppers search for specific items by image. You can refine the results by using URI parameters and filters. item: Lets you retrieve the details of a specific item or all the items in an item group, which is an item with variations such as color and size and check if a product is compatible with the specified item, such as if a specific car is compatible with a specific part. Provides a bridge between the eBay legacy APIs, such as Finding, and the RESTful APIs, which use different formats for the item IDs. &nbsp;(Experimental) shopping_cart: Provides the ability for eBay members to see the contents of their eBay cart, and add, remove, and change the quantity of items in their eBay cart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: This resource is not available in the eBay API Explorer. The item_summary, search_by_image, and item resource calls require an Application access token. The shopping_cart resource calls require a User access token.",
