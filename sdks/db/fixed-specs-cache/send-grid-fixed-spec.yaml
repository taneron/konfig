Once you have created a first key with scopes to manage additional API keys, you can use this API for all other key management.\n\n        > There is a limit of 100 API Keys on your account.\n\n        A JSON request body containing a `name` property is required when making requests to this endpoint. If the number of maximum keys, 100, is reached, a `403` status will be returned.\n\n        Though the `name` field is required, it does not need to be unique. A unique API key ID will be generated for each key you create and returned in the response body.\n\n        It is not necessary to pass a `scopes` field to the API when creating a key, but you should be aware that omitting the `scopes` field from your request will create a key with \"Full Access\" permissions by default.\n\n        See the [API Key Permissions List](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/how-to-use-the-sendgrid-v3-api/api-authorization) for all available scopes.

When creating designs from scratch, be aware of the styling constraints inherent to many email clients. For a list of best practices, see our guide to [Cross-Platform Email Design](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/cross-platform-html-design/).\n\n        The Design Library can also convert your design’s HTML elements into drag and drop modules that are editable in the Designs Library user interface.

If you choose to leave the `name` field blank, your duplicate will be assigned the name of the design it was copied from with the text \"Duplicate: \" prepended to it. This name change is only a convenience, as the duplicate design will be assigned a unique ID that differentiates it from your other designs. You can retrieve the IDs for Twilio SendGrid pre-built designs using the \"List SendGrid Pre-built Designs\" endpoint.\n\n        You can modify your duplicate’s name at the time of creation by passing an updated value to the `name` field when making the initial request.\n        More on retrieving design IDs can be found above.\n      operationId: POST-sendgrid-pre-built-design\n      requestBody:\n        $ref: \"#/components/requestBodies/design-duplicate-input\"\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              examples:\n                response:\n                  value:\n                    categories: []\n                    created_at: 2021-04-30T19:15:28Z\n                    editor: design\n                    generate_plain_content: true\n                    html_content: |-\n                      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n                      <html data-editor-version=\"2\" class=\"sg-campaigns\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n                          <head>\n                            <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

If you choose to leave the `name` field blank, your duplicate will be assigned the name of the design it was copied from with the text \"Duplicate: \" prepended to it. This name change is only a convenience, as the duplicate will be assigned a unique ID that differentiates it from your other designs.\n\n        You can modify your duplicate’s name at the time of creation by passing an updated value to the `name` field when making the initial request.\n        More on retrieving design IDs can be found below.\n      operationId: POST-design\n      requestBody:\n        $ref: \"#/components/requestBodies/design-duplicate-input\"\n      responses:\n        \"201\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              examples:\n                response:\n                  value:\n                    categories: []\n                    created_at: 2021-04-30T19:00:16Z\n                    editor: design\n                    generate_plain_content: false\n                    html_content: |-\n                      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n                      <html data-editor-version=\"2\" class=\"sg-campaigns\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n                          <head>\n                            <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

If you are looking for documentation about the v2 Mail Send endpoint, see our [v2 API Reference](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/mail.html).\n\n        ## Helper Libraries\n\n        Twilio SendGrid provides libraries to help you quickly and easily integrate with the v3 Web API in 7 different languages:\n\n        * [C#](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-csharp) \n        * [Go](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-go)\n        * [Java](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-java)\n        * [Node JS](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs)\n        * [PHP](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php)\n        * [Python](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python)\n        * [Ruby](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby)\n\n        ## Dynamic Transactional Templates and Handlebars\n\n        In order to send a dynamic template, specify the template ID with the `template_id` parameter. \n\n        To specify handlebar substitutions, define your substitutions in the request JSON with this syntax:\n\n        ```\n        \"dynamic_template_data\": {\n              \"guest\": \"Jane Doe\",\n              \"partysize\": \"4\",\n              \"english\": true,\n              \"date\": \"April 1st, 2021\"\n            }\n        ```\n\n        For more information about Dynamic Transactional Templates and Handlebars, see our documentation and reference pages.\n\n        * [How to send an email with Dynamic Transactional Templates\n        ](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-transactional-templates/)\n        * [Using Handlebars](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/using-handlebars/) \n\n        ## Mail Body Compression\n\n        Mail body compression is available to some high volume accounts. Talk to your CSM if you are interested in this functionality. Mail body compression works by setting up a JSON payload as defined on this page, then compressing it with gzip (the gzip file can be no more than 30mb).\n\n        To use mail body compression:\n\n        1. Add a `Content-Encoding` header, with a value of `gzip`.  \n           a. `Content-Encoding: gzip` \n        2. Send the gzip as a data-binary.  \n           a. `--data-binary '@data.json.gz'\n        `\n\n        ## Multiple Reply-To Emails\n\n        Using `reply_to_list` allows senders to include more than one recipient email address to receive reply and/or bounce messages from the recipient of the email.\n\n        ### Usage Considerations\n\n        * `reply_to` is mutually exclusive with `reply_to_list`. If both are used, then the API call will be rejected. \n        * The `reply_to_list` object, when used, must at least have an email parameter and may also contain a name parameter.\n        * Each email address in the `reply_to_list` should be unique.\n        * There is a limit of 1000 `reply_to_list` emails per mail/send request.\n        * In SMTP calls, we will omit any invalid emails.\n\n        ### Possible 400 Error Messages\n\n        * `reply_to` is mutually exclusive with `reply_to_list`.\n        * The `reply_to_list` object, when used, must at least have an email parameter and may also contain a name parameter.\n        * Each email address in the `reply_to_list` should be unique.\n        * There is a limit of X `reply_to` emails per mail/send request.\n        * The `reply_to_list` email does not contain a valid address.\n        * The `reply_to_list` email exceeds the maximum total length of X characters.\n        * The `reply_to_list` email parameter is required.\n      operationId: POST_mail-send\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              example:\n                asm:\n                  group_id: 12345\n                  groups_to_display:\n                    -

To remove one or more `list` entries, pass a `list` with only the entries you wish to retain.\n\n        You should not add generic domains such as `gmail.com` or `yahoo.com`  in your `list` because your emails will not honor recipients' unsubscribes. This may cause a legal violation of [CAN-SPAM](https://sendgrid.com/docs/glossary/can-spam/) and could damage your sending reputation.\n\n        The Address Whitelist setting allows you to specify email addresses or domains for which mail should never be suppressed.\n\n        For example, if you own the domain `example.com`, and one or more of your recipients use `email@example.com` addresses, placing `example.com` in the address whitelist setting instructs Twilio SendGrid to ignore all bounces, blocks, and unsubscribes logged for that domain.

Rather, it will contain an HTTP 202 response indicating the contacts are queued for processing or an HTTP 4XX error containing validation errors. Should you wish to get the resulting contact's ID or confirm your contacts have been updated or added, you can use the \"Get Contacts by Emails\" endpoint. \n\n        Please note that custom fields need to have been already created if you wish to set their values for the contacts being upserted. To do this, please use the \"Create Custom Field Definition\" endpoint.\n\n        You will see a `job_id` in the response to your request. This can be used to check the status of your upsert job. To do so, please use the \"Import Contacts Status\" endpoint.\n\n        If the contact already exists in the system, any entries submitted via this endpoint will update the existing contact. The contact to update will be determined only by the `email` field and any fields omitted from the request will remain as they were. A contact's ID cannot be used to update the contact.\n\n        The email field will be changed to all lower-case.

It allows you to use CSVs where one or more columns are skipped (`null`) or remapped to the contact field. \n\n        For example, if `field_mappings` is set to `[null, \"w1\", \"_rf1\"]`, this means skip column 0, map column 1 to the custom field with the ID `w1`, and map column 2 to the reserved field with the ID `_rf1`. See the \"Get All Field Definitions\" endpoint to fetch your custom and reserved field IDs to use with `field_mappings`.\n\n        Once you recieve the response body you can then initiate a **second** API call where you use the supplied URL and HTTP header to upload your file.

Although field names are stored in a case-sensitive manner, all field names must be case-insensitively unique. This means you may create a field named `CamelCase` or `camelcase`, but not both. Additionally, a Custom Field name cannot collide with any Reserved Field names. You should save the returned `id` value in order to update or delete the field at a later date. You can have up to 120 custom fields.\n\n        The custom field name should be created using only alphanumeric characters (A-Z and 0-9) and underscores (\\_). Custom fields can only begin with letters  A-Z or underscores (_). The field type can be date, text, or number fields. The field type is important for creating segments from your contact database.\n\n        **Note: Creating a custom field that begins with a number will cause issues with sending in Marketing Campaigns.**\n      operationId: POST_mc-field_definitions\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              example:\n                field_type: Text\n                name: custom_field_name\n              properties:\n                field_type:\n                  enum:\n                    - Text\n                    - Number\n                    - Date\n                  type: string\n                name:\n                  maxLength: 100\n                  minLength: 1\n                  type: string\n              required:\n                - name\n                - field_type\n              type: object\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              examples:\n                response:\n                  value:\n                    _metadata:\n                      self: https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing/field_definitions/a1_B\n                    field_type: Text\n                    id: a1_T\n                    name: custom_field_name\n              schema:\n                allOf:\n                  - $ref: \"#/components/schemas/custom_field_definitions_response\"\n                  - properties:\n                      _metadata:\n                        $ref: \"#/components/schemas/_metadata\"\n                    type: object\n          description: \"\"\n        \"400\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                properties:\n                  errors:\n                    items:\n                      $ref: \"#/components/schemas/error\"\n                    type: array\n                    uniqueItems: true\n                required:\n                  - errors\n                type: object\n          description: \"\"\n      security:\n        - Authorization: []\n      summary: Create Custom Field Definition\n      tags:\n        - Custom Fields\n  \"/marketing/field_definitions/{custom_field_id}\":\n    delete:\n      description: |-\n        **This endpoint deletes a defined Custom Field.**\n\n        You cand delete only Custom Fields;

If you need to complete domain authentication, you can use the [Twilio SendGrid App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth) or the \"Authenticate a domain\" endpoint. See \"[How to Set Up Domain Authentication](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication/)\" for instructions.\n\n        Any email received by the `hostname` will be parsed when you complete this setup. You must also add a Twilio SendGrid MX record to this domain's DNS records. See \"[Setting up the Inbound Parse Webhook](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/parsing-email/setting-up-the-inbound-parse-webhook/)\" for full instructions.\n\n        The `url` represents a location where the parsed message data will be delivered. Twilio SendGrid will make an HTTP POST request to this `url` with the message data. The `url` must be publicly reachable, and your application must return a `200` status code to signal that the message data has been received.\n      operationId: POST_user-webhooks-parse-settings\n      parameters:\n        -

When using Automated Security, SendGrid provides you with three CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you are instead given TXT and MX records.\n\n        If you pass a `link_id` to this endpoint, the generated email will supply the DNS records necessary to complete [Link Branding](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-link-branding/) setup. If you pass a `domain_id` to this endpoint, the generated email will supply the DNS records needed to complete [Domain Authentication](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication/). Passing both IDs will generate an email with the records needed to complete both setup steps.\n\n        You can retrieve all your domain IDs from the returned `id` fields for each domain using the \"List all authenticated domains\" endpoint. You can retrieve all of your link IDs using the \"Retrieve all branded links\" endpoint.\n      operationId: POST_whitelabel-dns-email\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              example:\n                domain_id: 46873408\n                email: my_colleague@example.com\n                link_id: 29719392\n                message: DNS Record for verification\n              properties:\n                domain_id:\n                  description: The ID of your SendGrid domain record.\n                  minimum: 0\n                  type: integer\n                email:\n                  description: The email address to send the DNS information to.\n                  format: email\n                  type: string\n                link_id:\n                  minimum: 0\n                  type: integer\n                  x-desc: The ID of the branded link.\n                message:\n                  default: Please set these DNS records in our hosting solution.\n                  description: A custom text block to include in the email body sent with the records.\n                  type: string\n              required:\n                - link_id\n                - domain_id\n                - email\n              type: object\n      responses:\n        \"204\":\n          description: \"\"\n        \"400\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                properties:\n                  errors:\n                    properties:\n                      error:\n                        type: string\n                      field:\n                        type: string\n                    type: object\n                type: object\n          description: \"\"\n      security:\n        - Authorization: []\n      summary: Email DNS records to a co-worker\n      tags:\n        - Email CNAME records\n  /whitelabel/domains:\n    get:\n      description: \"**This endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of all domains you have authenticated.**\"\n      operationId: GET_whitelabel-domains\n      parameters:\n        - description: Number of domains to return.\n          in: query\n          name: limit\n          schema:\n            type: integer\n        - description: Paging offset.\n          in: query\n          name: offset\n          schema:\n            type: integer\n        - description: Exclude subuser domains from the result.\n          in: query\n          name: exclude_subusers\n          schema:\n            type: boolean\n        - description: The username associated with an authenticated domain.\n          in: query\n          name: username\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - description: Search for authenticated domains.\n          in: query\n          name: domain\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/trait_onBehalfOfSubuser_on-behalf-of\"\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              examples:\n                response:\n                  value:\n                    - automatic_security: true\n                      custom_spf: true\n                      default: true\n                      dns:\n                        dkim1:\n                          data: s1._domainkey.u7.wl.sendgrid.net\n                          host: s1._domainkey.example.com\n                          type: cname\n                          valid: true\n                        dkim2:\n                          data: s2._domainkey.u7.wl.sendgrid.net\n                          host: s2._domainkey.example.com\n                          type: cname\n                          valid: true\n                        mail_cname:\n                          data: u7.wl.sendgrid.net\n                          host: mail.example.com\n                          type: cname\n                          valid: true\n                      domain: example.com\n                      id: 1\n                      ips:\n                        - 192.168.1.1\n                        - 192.168.1.2\n                      legacy: false\n                      subdomain: mail\n                      user_id: 7\n                      username: jane@example.com\n                      valid: true\n                    - automatic_security: true\n                      custom_spf: false\n                      default: true\n                      dns:\n                        dkim1:\n                          data: k=rsa;

Use the Association workflow (see Associate Domain section). This allows you to authenticate a domain created by the parent to a subuser. This means the subuser will default to the assigned domain, but will not be able to see or modify that authenticated domain.

This enables you to perform a prefix search for a given IP segment (e.g., `?ip=\"192.\"`).\n\n        Use the `limit` query string parameter to reduce the number of records returned. All records will be returned if you have fewer records than the specified limit.\n\n        The `offset` query string parameter allows you to specify a non-zero index from which records will be returned. For example, if you have ten records, `?offset=5` will return the last five records (at indexes 5 through 9). The list starts at index zero.\n      operationId: GET_whitelabel-ips\n      parameters:\n        - description: The maximum number of results to retrieve.\n          in: query\n          name: limit\n          schema:\n            type: integer\n        - description: The point in the list of results to begin retrieving IP addresses from.\n          in: query\n          name: offset\n          schema:\n            type: integer\n        - description: The IP address segment that you'd like to use in a prefix search.\n          in: query\n          name: ip\n          schema:\n            type: string\n        - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/trait_onBehalfOfSubuser_on-behalf-of\"\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              examples:\n                response:\n                  value:\n                    - a_record:\n                        data: 192.168.1.1\n                        host: o1.email.example.com\n                        type: a\n                        valid: true\n                      domain: example.com\n                      id: 1\n                      ip: 192.168.1.1\n                      legacy: false\n                      rdns: o1.email.example.com\n                      subdomain: email\n                      users:\n                        - user_id: 7\n                          username: john@example.com\n                        - user_id: 8\n                          username: jane@example.com\n                      valid: true\n                    - a_record:\n                        data: 192.168.1.2\n                        host: o2.email.example.com\n                        type: a\n                        valid: true\n                      domain: example.com\n                      id: 2\n                      ip: 192.168.1.2\n                      legacy: false\n                      rdns: o2.email.example.com\n                      subdomain: email\n                      users:\n                        - user_id: 7\n                          username: john@example.com\n                        - user_id: 9\n                          username: jane@example2.com\n                      valid: true\n              schema:\n                items:\n                  $ref: \"#/components/schemas/reverse_dns\"\n                type: array\n          description: \"\"\n      security:\n        - Authorization: []\n      summary: Retrieve all reverse DNS records\n      tags:\n        - Reverse DNS\n    post:\n      description: \"**This endpoint allows you to set up reverse DNS.**\"\n      operationId: POST_whitelabel-ips\n      parameters:\n        - $ref: \"#/components/parameters/trait_onBehalfOfSubuser_on-behalf-of\"\n      requestBody:\n        content:\n          application/json:\n            schema:\n              example:\n                domain: example.com\n                ip: 192.168.1.1\n                subdomain: email\n              properties:\n                domain:\n                  description: The root, or sending, domain that will be used to send message from the IP address.\n                  type: string\n                ip:\n                  description: The IP address for which you want to set up reverse DNS.\n                  type: string\n                subdomain:\n                  description: The subdomain that will be used to send emails from the IP address.
