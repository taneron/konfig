          to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will

          to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will

          Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this
          means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable.

          Offset token.

          An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request
          will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter
          to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will
          return the first page of results.

          previously paginated request.'

          Offset token.

          An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request
          will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter
          to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will
          return the first page of results.

          'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a
          previously paginated request.'

          Offset token.

          An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request
          will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter
          to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will
          return the first page of results.

          'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a
          previously paginated request.'

          Results per page.

          The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1
          and 100.

          Offset token.

          An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request
          will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter
          to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will
          return the first page of results.

          'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a
          previously paginated request.'

          change, or associations between it and other objects are modified
          (e.g.  a task being added to a project). A task is not considered
          modified just because another object it is associated with (e.g. a

          include assigning, renaming, completing, and adding stories.*

          Results per page.

          The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1
          and 100.
        example: 50
      - name: offset

          Offset token.

          An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request
          will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter
          to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will
          return the first page of results.

          'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a
          previously paginated request.'

          Offset token.

          An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request
          will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter
          to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will
          return the first page of results.

          'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a
          previously paginated request.'

          Sadly, sometimes requests to the API are not successful. Failures can

          occur for a wide range of reasons. In all cases, the API should return

          an HTTP Status Code that indicates the nature of the failure,

          with a response body in JSON format containing additional information.



          In the event of a server error the response body will contain an error

          phrase. These phrases are automatically generated using the
