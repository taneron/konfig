        The API uses HTTP Basic Auth for authentication.


        You are requested to preemptively provide the `Authorization` header in
        your requests and not wait until the server has provided a `401
        Unauthorized` response.


        Doing so will reduce the number of requests required to achieve your
        goal, which will improve overall performance.


        You authenticate using either the username you supplied when you
        registered with [BulkSMS](https://www.bulksms.com) or with an _API
        Token_. API tokens can be created by logging into your account and
        visiting _Settings &gt; Developer Settings &gt; API Tokens_.


        __Important:__

        - Where possible, use an API Token instead of the username and password
        when writing software against the API.


        Whether you use a username or an API Token, the values must be [Base64
        encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) before using it in the
        header.

        For example, if the username is `Aladdin` and the password is
        `OpenSesame`, the unencoded header value is `Aladdin:OpenSesame`.  After
        encoding, the full header becomes


        ```

        Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l

        ```

        When using an API token, the value to be encoded will be
        `<token-id>:<token-secret>`.  These values _before Base64 encoding_ look
        something like this

    ## Overview


    The JSON REST API allows you to submit and receive
    [BulkSMS](https://www.bulksms.com/) messages. You can also get access to
    past messages and see your account profile.


    The base URL to use for this service is `https://api.bulksms.com/v1`.  The
    base URL cannot be used on its own; you must append a path that identifies
    an operation and you may have to specify some path parameters as well.


    [Click here](https://www.bulksms.com) to go to the main BulkSMS developer
    site.


    In order to give you an idea on how the API can be used, some JSON snippets
    are provided below.  Have a look at the [messages
    section](https://www.bulksms.com) for more information.


    Probably the most simple example


    ```

    {
        "to": "+27001234567",
        "body": "Hello World!"
    }

    ```



    You can send unicode automatically using the `auto-unicode` query
    parameter. 

    Alternatively, you can specify `UNICODE` for the `encoding` property in the
    request body. 

    Please note: when `auto-unicode` is specified and the value of the
    `encoding` property is `UNICODE`, the message will always be sent as
    `UNICODE`.


    Here is an example that sets the `encoding` explicitly


    ```

    {
      "to": "+27001234567",
      "body": "Dobrá práce! Jak se máš?",
      "encoding": "UNICODE"
    }

    ```


    You can also specify a from number


    ```

    {
        "from": "+27007654321",
        "to": "+27001234567",
        "body": "Hello World!"
    }

    ```


    Similar to above, but repliable


    ```

    {
        "from": { "type": "REPLIABLE" },
        "to": "+27001234567",
        "body": "Hello World!"
    }

    ```


    A message to a group called Everyone


    ```

    {
        "to": { "type": "GROUP", "name": "Everyone" },
        "body": "Hello World!"
    }

    ```


    A message to multiple recipients


    ```

    {
        "to": ["+27001234567", "+27002345678", "+27003456789"],
        "body": "Happy Holidays!"
    }

    ```


    Sending more than one message in the same request


    ```

    [
        {
            "to": "+27001234567",
            "body": "Hello World!"
        },
        {
            "to": "+27002345678",
            "body": "Hello Universe!"
        }
    ]

    ```


    **The insecure base URL `http://api.bulksms.com/v1` is deprecated** and may
    in future result in a `301` redirect response, or insecure requests may be
    rejected outright. Please use the secure (`https`) URI above.


    ### HTTP Content Type


    All API methods expect requests to supply a `Content-Type` header with the
    value `application/json`. All responses will have the `Content-Type` header
    set to `application/json`.


    ### JSON Formatting


    You are advised to format your JSON resources according to strict JSON
    format rules. While the API does attempt to parse strictly invalid JSON
    documents, doing so may lead to incorrect interpretation and unexpected
    results.


    Good JSON libraries will produce valid JSON suitable for submission, but if
    you are manually generating the JSON text, be careful to follow the JSON
    format. This include correct escaping of control characters and double
    quoting of property names.


    See the [JSON specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627) for
    further information.


    ### Date Formatting


    Dates are formatted according to ISO-8601, such as
    `1970-01-01T10:00:00+01:00` for 1st January 1970, 10AM UTC+1.


    See the [Wikipedia ISO 8601
    reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) for further information.


    Specifically, calendar dates are formatted with the 'extended' format
    `YYYY-MM-DD`. Basic format, week dates and ordinal dates are not supported.
    Times are also formatted in the 'extended' format `hh:mm:ss`. Hours, minutes
    and seconds are mandatory. Offset from UTC must be provided; this is to
    ensure that there is no misunderstanding regarding times provided to the
    API.


    The format we look for is `yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss[Z|[+-]hh:mm]`


    Examples of valid date/times are`2011-12-31T12:00:00Z`
    `2011-12-31T12:00:00+02:00`


    ### Entity Format Modifications


    It is expected that over time some changes will be made to the request and
    response formats of various methods available in the API.

    Where possible, these will be implemented in a backwards compatible way.

    To make this possible you are required to ignore unknown properties.

    This enables the addition of information in response documents while
    maintaining compatibility with older clients.


    ### Optional Request Entity Properties


    There are many instances where requests can be made without having to
    specify every single property allowable in the request format.

    Any such optional properties are noted as such in the documentation and
    their default value is noted.
