        summary: Adds a token to an existing event template
        description: >-
          Once you've defined an event template, it's likely that you'll want to
          define tokens for it as well. You can do this on the event template
          itself or update individual tokens here.


          Event type tokens allow you to attach custom data to events displayed in
          a timeline or used for list segmentation.


          You can also use `objectPropertyName` to associate any CRM object
          properties. This will allow you to fully build out CRM objects.


          Token names should be unique across the template.

          This will remove the token from an existing template. Existing events
          and CRM objects will still retain the token and its mapped object
          properties, but new ones will not.


          The timeline will still display this property for older CRM objects if
          it's still referenced in the template `Markdown`. New events will not.


          Any lists or reports referencing deleted tokens will no longer return
          new contacts, but old ones will still exist in the lists.

        summary: Create an event template for your app
        description: >-
          Event templates define the general structure for a custom timeline
          event. This includes formatted copy for its heading and details, as well
          as any custom property definitions. The event could be something like
          viewing a video, registering for a webinar, or filling out a survey. A
          single app can define multiple event templates.


          Event templates will be created for contacts by default, but they can be
          created for companies, tickets, and deals as well.


          Each event template contains its own set of tokens and `Markdown`
          templates. These tokens can be associated with any CRM object properties
          via the `objectPropertyName` field to fully build out CRM objects.


          You must create an event template before you can create events.

              For `deals` pipelines, the `probability` field is required (`{
              "probability": 0.5 }`), and represents the likelihood a deal will
              close. Possible values are between 0.0 and 1.0 in increments of 0.1.


              For `tickets` pipelines, the `ticketState` field is optional (`{
              "ticketState": "OPEN" }`), and represents whether the ticket remains
              open or has been closed by a member of your Support team. Possible
              values are `OPEN` or `CLOSED`.
            example:
              ticketState: CLOSED

              A collection of token keys and values associated with the template
              tokens.
            example:
              petAge: '3'
              petName: Art3mis
              petColor: black
          id:
            type: string
            description: >-
              Identifier for the event. This should be unique to the app and event
              template. If you use the same ID for different CRM objects, the last
              to be processed will win and the first will not have a record. You
              can also use `{{uuid}}` anywhere in the ID to generate a unique
              string, guaranteeing uniqueness.
            example: petspot:1001298:art3mis-pup@petspot.com-004-invalid
          utk:
            type: string
            description: >-
              Use the `utk` parameter to associate an event with a contact by
              `usertoken`. This is recommended if you don't know a user's email,
              but have an identifying user token in your cookie.
          email:
            type: string
            description: >-
              The email address used for contact-specific events. This can be used
              to identify existing contacts, create new ones, or change the email
              for an existing contact (if paired with the `objectId`).
            example: art3mis-pup@petspot.com
          objectId:
            type: string
            description: >-
              The CRM object identifier. This is required for every event other
              than contacts (where utk or email can be used).
            example: '28001'
          timestamp:
            type: string
            description: >-
              The time the event occurred. If not passed in, the curren time will
              be assumed. This is used to determine where an event is shown on a
              CRM object's timeline.
