At Konfig, we are rapidly making progress towards building the easiest way to
onboard developers to your API. To keep our followers up-to-date, we are
starting this newsletter that will feature 2-3 of our biggest product updates
and little fixes.

### STATISTICS.md

Now `konfig generate` will generate a file named `STATISTICS.md` that contains a
count for `Lines of Code` in each SDK for your API. Here is an example that we
generated. This file is generated in the same directory as your `konfig.yaml`
file. In the future, we would also like to add more data such as weekly
downloads.

```markdown STATISTICS.md
# SDK Statistics

| SDK Name   | Lines of Code |
|------------|---------------|
| java       | 89900         |
| ruby       | 47516         |
| python     | 104319        |
| typescript | 18063         |
| csharp     | 58322         |
| php        | 99705         |
| **Total**  | 417825        |
```

### Interactive Tutorial

Our [interactive tutorial](/interactive-tutorial) is now live! Learn how to
generate SDKs with a guided interface. This is a great way to get started with
Konfig if you would like to generate SDKs yourself.

### Improved TypeScript SDK Error

Instead of just throwing the error from the underlying request library,
[axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), we now generate a file called
`error.ts` that contains a custom `Error` class. The name of the class is based
off the client name in your `konfig.yaml` file.  The new custom error message
has a cleaner interface and better inline documentation. In a
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) API environment, the logged errors now exclude a
lot of the garbage that was not helpful when debugging.

```typescript error.ts
/**
 * This class provides a wrapper for network errors when making requests to OpenAPI Petstore
 */
export class AcmeError extends Error {
  /**
   * The response body
   */
  readonly responseBody: unknown;

  /**
   * The error code provided from the underlying "axios" library which can be
   * more descriptive than the HTTP status descriptions.
   */
  readonly code?: string;

  /**
   * The status code from the response.
   * For explanations, refer to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status
   */
  readonly status?: number;

  /**
   * The status text from the response.
   * For explanations, refer to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status
   */
  readonly statusText?: string;

  /**
   * The URL that the original request was sent to
   */
  readonly url?: string;

  /**
   * HTTP request method (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)
   */
  readonly method?: string;
```
