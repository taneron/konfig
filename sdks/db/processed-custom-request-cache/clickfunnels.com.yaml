    # Introduction


    The ClickFunnels v2 API lets you:


    - import data from other apps and sources into ClickFunnels and export data
    that you need somewhere else

    - extend the ClickFunnels platform to your own needs and embed it in your
    own applications

    - act on behalf of other ClickFunnels users via OAuth to offer extended
    services to other fellow ClickFunnels entrepreneurs


    We are starting with exposing a given set of resources but the goal is to
    converge in terms of

    functionality with what the actual app is offering and also offering
    functionality on top.

    # Authentication


    Making your first request is easiest with a Bearer token:


    ```shell

    $ curl 'https://myteam.myclickfunnels.com/api/v2/teams' \

    --header 'Authorization: Bearer AVJrj0ZMJ-xoraUk1xxVM6UuL9KXmsWmnJvvSosUO6X'

    [{"id":3,"name":"My Team", # ... more output...}]

    ```


    How to get your API key step by step:


    https://developers.myclickfunnels.com/docs/getting-started


    # Rate limiting


    The rate limit is currently set per IP address.


    The actual rate limit and the approach on how this is handled is subject to
    change in future

    releases. Please let us know if you have special request limit needs.


    # Pagination and Ordering


    In order to paginate through a large list response, you can use our
    cursor-based pagination using

    the `id` field of a given object in the list.


    There is a limit of 20 objects per list response ordered ascending by ID.
    So, you can get to items

    after the last one in the list, by taking the last item's ID and submitting
    it in a list request

    as the value of an `after` URL parameter. For example:


    ```shell

    # The first 20 contacts are returned without any pagination nor ordering
    params:

    $ curl 'https://myteam.myclickfunnels.com/api/v2/workspaces/3/contacts'
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer ...'

    [{"id": 1, "email_address": "first@contact.com" ...}, {"id": 4, ...} ...
    {"id": 55, "email_address": "last@contact.com", ...}]


    $ curl
    'https://myteam.myclickfunnels.com/api/v2/workspaces/3/contacts?after=55'
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer ...'

    [{"id": 56, ...}] # There is one more record after ID 55.

    ```


    The `after` param always acts as if you are "turning the next page". So if
    you order in a descending

    order, you will also use `after` to get to the next records:


    ```shell

    $ curl
    'https://myteam.myclickfunnels.com/api/v2/workspaces/3/contacts?sort_order=desc'
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer ...'

    [{"id": 56, ...},  {"id": 55, ...}, {"id": 4, ...}] # All contacts in
    descending order.


    $ curl
    'https://myteam.myclickfunnels.com/api/v2/workspaces/3/contacts?sort_order=desc&after=4'
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer ...'

    [{"id": 1, ...}] # There is one more contact on the next page after ID 55.

    ```


    You can also use the `Pagination-Next` header to get the last ID value
    directly:


    ```http request

    # Example header.

    Pagination-Next: 55

    ```


    And you can use the `Link` header to get the next page directly without
    needing to calculate it

    yourself:


    ```http request

    # Example header.

    Link:
    <https://localteam.myclickfunnels.com/api/v2/workspaces/3/contacts?after=55>;
    rel="next"

    ```


    # Filtering


    **Current filters**


    If filtering is available for a specific endpoint, 'filter' will be listed
    as one of the options in the query parameters section of the Request area.
    Attributes by which you can filter will be listed as well.


    **How it works**


    There is a filter mechanism that adheres to some simple conventions. The
    filters provided on

    list endpoints, like `filter[email_address]` and `filter[id]` on the
    `Contacts` list endpoint, need

    to be "simple" and "fast". These filters are supposed to be easy to use and
    allow you to filter by

    one or more concrete values.


    Here's an example of how you could use the filter to find a contact with a
    certain email address:


    ```shell

    $ curl -g
    'https://myteam.myclickfunnels.com/api/v2/workspaces/3/contacts?filter[email_address]=you@cf.com'
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer ...'

    [{"email_address": "you@cf.com",...}]

    ```


    You can also filter by multiple values:


    ```shell

    $ curl -g
    'https://myteam.myclickfunnels.com/api/v2/workspaces/3/contacts?filter[email_address]=you@cf.com,u2@cf.com'
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer ...'

    [{"email_address": "you@cf.com",...}, {"email_address": "u2@cf.com",...}]

    ```


    You can also filter by multiple attributes. Similar to filters that you
    might be familiar with when

    using GitHub (e.g.: filtering PRs by closed and assignee), those filters are
    `AND` filters, which

    give you the intersection of multiple records:


    ```shell

    # If you@cf.com comes with an ID of 1, you will only see this record for
    this API call:

    $ curl -g
    'https://myteam.myclickfunnels.com/api/v2/workspaces/3/contacts?filter[email_address]=you@cf.com,u2@cf.com&filter[id]=1'
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer ...'

    [{"email_address": "you@cf.com",...}] 

    # u2@cf.com is not included because it has a different ID that is not
    included in the filter.

    ```

    capabilities, we are

    # Webhooks


    ClickFunnels webhooks allow you to react to many events in the ClickFunnels
    app on your own server, 

    Zapier and other similar tools.


    You need to configure one or more endpoints within the ClickFunnels API by
    using the
    [Webhooks::Outgoing::Endpoints](https://apidocs.myclickfunnels.com/tag/Webhooks::Outgoing::Endpoint) 

    endpoint with the `event_type_ids` that you want to listen to (see below for
    all types).


    Once configured, you will receive POST requrests from us to the configured
    endpoint URL with the

    [Webhooks::Outgoing::Event](https://apidocs.myclickfunnels.com/tag/Webhooks::Outgoing::Event#operation/getWebhooksOutgoingEvents) 

    payload, that will contain the subject payload in the `data` property. Like
    here for the

    `contact.identified` webhook in V2 version:


    ```json

    {
      "id": null,
      "public_id": "YVIOwX",
      "workspace_id": 32,
      "uuid": "94856650751bb2c141fc38436fd699cb",
      "event_type_id": "contact.identified",
      "subject_id": 100,
      "subject_type": "Contact",
      "data": {
        "id": 12,
        "public_id": "fdPJAZ",
        "workspace_id": 32,
        "anonymous": null,
        "email_address": "joe.doe@example.com",
        "first_name": "Joe",
        "last_name": "Doe",
        "phone_number": "1-241-822-5555",
        "time_zone": "Pacific Time (US & Canada)",
        "uuid": "26281ba2-7d3b-524d-8ea3-b01ff8414120",
        "unsubscribed_at": null,
        "last_notification_email_sent_at": null,
        "fb_url": "https://www.facebook.com/example",
        "twitter_url": "https://twitter.com/example",
        "instagram_url": "https://instagram.com/example",
        "linkedin_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/example",
        "website_url": "https://example.com",
        "created_at": "2023-12-31T18:57:40.871Z",
        "updated_at": "2023-12-31T18:57:40.872Z",
        "tags": [
          {
            "id": 20,
            "public_id": "bRkQrc",
            "name": "Example Tag",
            "color": "#59b0a8"
          }
        ]
      },
      "created_at": "2023-12-31T18:57:41.872Z"
    }

    ```


    The content of the `data` property will vary depending on the event type
    that you are receiving.


    Event types are structured like this: `subject.action`. So, for a
    `contact.identified` webhook, your

    `data` payload will contain data that you can source from [the contact
    response schema/example in the

    documentation](https://apidocs.myclickfunnels.com/tag/Contact#operation/getContacts).
    Similarly, for

    webhooks like `order.created` and `one-time-order.identified`, you will find
    the documentation in

    [the Order resource
    description](https://apidocs.myclickfunnels.com/tag/Order#operation/getOrders).
