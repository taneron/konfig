Access Forem articles, users and other resources via API.
        For a real-world example of Forem in action, check out [DEV](https://www.dev.to).
        All endpoints can be accessed with the 'api-key' header and a accept header, but
        some of them are accessible publicly without authentication.

        Dates and date times, unless otherwise specified, must be in
        the [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format.
