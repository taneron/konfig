      ### Product
        A product is the stock keeping unit (SKU), the item to sale. The attributes of a product could include manufacturer, material, service, warranty terms.
        The PIM is the repository of all products used by the different services of the solution

      ### Offer
        An offer is a set of products and represents the commercial agreements sent by the merchant.
        An offer can have:
        -  one or many products
        -  Prices
        -  Additional services
        -  A publication period, during this period the offer is active and can be ordered

      ### Order
        An order contains information allowing to purchase some offers.
        An order has one or several order lines, and each order line is for an offer.
        The order has mandatory information such as amounts, payments, and addresses.

      ### Dates
        All Gridbees services use UTC datetime and the default format is: <b>yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ</b>.

          This service is used to calculate all prices of a basket.

          The service discards all input prices coming within the request and set
          all known prices inside the basket. If a price hasn’t been found, the
          service returns an error.

          The input basket is controlled before to be valorized. The checklist is:

          -  existence of at least one basket line

          -  each basket line must have a unique offer identifier, and the offer
          is published

          -  the requested quantity is a positive value

          -   if a vendor exists and not blocked

          -  Check the validity of the promocode if given


          The service set the price:

          -  for each offer of the basket

          -  for each additionnal services attached to the offers


          If for a basket line, many prices exist due to for example a typology of
          price (National price, local, advertising price, …), the service applies
          the business logic to find the good price.


          Once all prices and all checks are OK, the service applies all active
          promotions on the basket.

          An active promotion, is published promotion such as the period include
          the submission date of the basket.


          Promotions are divided into:

          -  a list of conditions (minimum of basket amount, a specific product,
          ..)

          -  a list of benefits (discount in percentage, added offer, discount on
          delivery fees, …)


          If for a given active promotion, the basket satisfies all the
          conditions, then all the benefits are applied to the basket.

          At the end, the service calculates some hash control to guaranty the
          prices won’t be altered.

          The hash is stored in the amount node of the basket and each lines.

          If you use Gridbees Booking service, those hash will be recalculated by
          the booking service.

          The value of the hash in the request will be compared with the value
          obtained by the booking service.


          The service uses these fields to create the hash:

          - amount.grossamount

          - amount.netamount

          - amount.commissionamount

          - amount.totaltopay

          - amount.totaltorefund

          - amount.discountamount

          - amount.additionalserviceamount

          - amount.additionalassemblyamount

          - amount.additionalrecoveryamount

          - amount.feesdiscountamount

          - amount.discountamount

          - amount.adjustedamount

          - amount.fees

          - ordertracking .vendorcode

          - line.offerid

          - line.quantity

          - line.offerbookingdate

          - line.offerbookinghour


          The service uses the algorithm SHA-256 to generate the hash by adding a
          secret key.

          This method is used to reserve some offers. This action will block the
          stock of the requested quantity for each offer.

          Most of the time, this request is done to guaranty to the client the
          reservation is blocked for a duration (configuration parameter).


          During this duration, the merchant application will have time to process
          the payment of the reservation.


          All amount information comes from a [pricing
          service](https://assets-global.website-files.com).

          If you use the Gridbees price valorization service, the list of data
          coming for this valorization service are:

          -  All Amount nodes

          -  Marketing information such as promotion code,

          -  List of all rules applied to the orders

          - Hash control data to guaranty the quality of the data


          Once the payment has been made, the reservation must be confirmed,
          otherwise the system will un the reservation after the duration and
          unblock the stoks.


          The service applies some operations such as:

          -  If a vendor is filled, some controls on the vendor conditions

          -  All mandatory fields are present including passenger’s information

          -  Calculation on hash amounts to guaranty the non-alteration


          The service returns:

          - in case of success (ordercontext.status = OK), the order reference
          (ordertracking.transactionnumber) of the reservation

          - otherwise (ordercontext.status = KO), the business error code
          (ordercontext.code)

          orderid field) and make some coherence controls.

          -  Overdue payment or not balanced payment

          -  Burns “one shot used” promotional vouchers

          detected, email template detected, ...)

          -  Stores and controls different payment modes used to pay the order

          This service is used to cancel an order and release if needed the stock.

          An order can be cancelled if it has been already paid or not already
          cancelled.

          The service searches for the order and calculates the cancellation fees
          according to the terms of sales.

          This method is used to updat an existing pending or confirmed order.
          Depending of the configuration, some changes are considered major and
          others minor. The list of major fields must be set during the
          configuration of a new client.

          For an input request, if there are major changes:

          - The order is reavaluated by the pricing service to check the new
          balance

          - The stock availability of the original order is released if the
          availability of the new order is confirmed.

          - The original order is replaced by the new order


          This service doesn't merge data from the original order with the new
          order. So you need to fill all necessary fields in the new order.


          If the original oder was already confirmed and paid, the requested
          changes may generate some cancellation fees depending of the
          cancellation terms.

          This method is used to directly confirm a purchase without having to
          call booking/request.

          This means that inventory management is unnecessary with this method
          since no stock will be blocked.

          The input request is supposed to be reliable, and the order will be
          stored as-is.

          If the order reference isn't filled (ordertracking.transactionnumber),
          the service will set this field with a unique internal reference.
