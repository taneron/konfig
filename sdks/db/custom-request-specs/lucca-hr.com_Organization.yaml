      title: The Axis Section resource

        ## Introduction


        In some application contexts, resources can be attached to analytical
        items. In most cases, the goal is to answer the needs of cost
        accounting. Axes are primarily used by Timmi Timesheet & Cleemy
        Expenses.


        Both in Timmi Timesheet and Cleemy Expense, users can enter their
        working hours or expenses spent on projects, tasks, work sites, cost
        centers, etc... These are the `AxisSection[]`, categorized in `Axis[]`.
        These axes can have parent-children relationships, and their
        axis-sections as well.


        ![axis-section-diagram.png](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjEwNjgxNg/images/y74HUrks5dQ)


        ## Example


        Let's take an example. Say you expect your users to enter spent working
        hours on each project. Each project belongs to a single client, and is
        divided into tasks.


        In other words:


        - Clients
          - (1..n) Projects: each project belongs to one, and one only, client.
            - (n..n) Tasks: each task belongs to one or more project(s). 

        Then:

        - Each client is an `AxisSection` in the "Clients" `Axis`.

        - One client has zero or more projects, which are `AxisSection[]` in the
        "Projects" `Axis`. A project is child to one and only one client.

        - One project has zero or more tasks, which are `AxisSection[]` in the
        "Tasks" `Axis`. Each task axis-section is child to one or more
        project(s) axis-sections.


        The JSON representation of these axes in the API would be:


        ```json

        // GET /api/v3/axes HTTP/1.1

        {
          "data": {
            "items": [
              {
                "id": 1,
                "name": "Clients",
                "parentAxisId": null,
                "isNNRelation": false
              },
              {
                "id": 2,
                "name": "Projects",
                "parentAxisId": 1,
                "isNNRelation": false
              },
              {
                "id": 3,
                "name": "Tasks",
                "parentAxisId": 2,
                "isNNRelation": true
              }
            ]
          }
        }

        ```


        Regarding axis-sections:


        ```json

        // GET /api/v3/axisSections HTTP/1.1

        Departments, to which users must be attached, are used by the different
        Lucca solutions for different purposes:


        * Define access scopes: for example to restrict the visibility of
        absences in the Timmi Absences schedule.

        * Filtering data in a report: our different reports generally allow to
        filter data according to the legal entity, the SSC, but also the
        department of the user.

        * Build the organization chart in Poplee Core HR.

        The departments are represented as a hierarchical tree with a
        parent/child relationship.


        *NB:* You can have up to 9 levels of departments, and up to 99
        departments under a single parent department. However, limiting the
        number of levels to 7 is recommended.
