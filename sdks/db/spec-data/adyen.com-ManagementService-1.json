  "apiDescription": "Configure and manage your Adyen company and merchant accounts, stores, and payment terminals.\n## Authentication\nEach request to the Management API must be signed with an API key. [Generate your API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key) in the Customer Area and then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value.\n\nTo access the live endpoints, you need to generate a new API key in your live Customer Area.\n## Versioning\n\nManagement API handles versioning as part of the endpoint URL. For example, to send a request to this version of the `/companies/{companyId}/webhooks` endpoint, use:\n\n```text\nhttps://management-test.adyen.com/v1/companies/{companyId}/webhooks\n```\n\n## Going live\n\nTo access the live endpoints, you need an API key from your live Customer Area. Use this API key to make requests to:\n\n```text\nhttps://management-live.adyen.com/v1\n```\n\n## Release notes\nHave a look at the [release notes](https://docs.adyen.com/release-notes/management-api) to find out what changed in this version!",
