  apiDescription: >
    The Tilled API is organized around
    [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer).

    Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request
    bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response
    codes, authentication, and verbs.


    You can use the Tilled API in test mode, which does not affect your live
    data or interact with the banking networks.

    The API key you use to authenticate the request determines whether the
    request is live mode or test mode.

    Before your account is activated you will only be able to interact with test
    mode.


    Authentication uses a standard web token schema.


    **Notice**: The Tilled API treats HTTP status `401` to mean
    `Unauthenticated`

    and not the HTTP standard name of `Unauthorized`.

    Requests made for materials the requester does not have permission to
    access, the API will respond with `403: Forbidden`.


    # Authentication


    The tilled API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and
    manage your API keys in the

    Tilled Dashboard.


    Test mode secret keys have the prefix sk*test* and live mode secret keys
    have the prefix sk*live*.

    Alternatively, you can use restricted API keys for granular permissions.


    Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not
    share your secret API keys

    in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.


    Authentication to the API is performed via custom HTTP Header
    `tilled-api-key`. Provide your API key as the value.


    All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will
    fail. API requests

    without authentication will also fail.

    # Errors


    Tilled uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or
    failure of an API request.

    In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx`
    range indicate an error

    that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was
    omitted, a charge failed,

    etc.). Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Tilled's servers
    (these are rare).


    Some `4xx` errors that could be handled programmatically (e.g., a card is
    declined)

    include an error code that briefly explains the error reported.


    # Request IDs


    Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this
    value in the response headers, under `request-id`. If you need to contact us
    about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the
    fastest possible resolution.


    # Metadata


    Updatable Tilled objects—including [Account](https://api.tilled.com),
    [Customer](https://api.tilled.com), [PaymentIntent](https://api.tilled.com),
    [Refund](https://api.tilled.com), and
    [Subscription](https://api.tilled.com)—have a `metadata` parameter. You can
    use this parameter to attach key-value data to these Tilled objects.


    You can specify up to 50 keys, with key names up to 40 characters long and
    values up to 500 characters long.


    Metadata is useful for storing additional, structured information on an
    object. As an example, you could store your user's full name and
    corresponding unique identifier from your system on a Tilled
    [Customer](https://api.tilled.com) object. Metadata is not used by
    Tilled—for example, not used to authorize or decline a charge—and won't be
    seen by your users unless you choose to show it to them. Do not store any
    sensitive information (bank account numbers, card details, etc.) as
    metadata.


    # Apple Pay


    Tilled supports Apple Pay through the Tilled.js
    [`PaymentRequest`](https://docs.tilled.com/tilledjs/#paymentrequest-ie-apple-pay)
    object.


    In order to start accepting payments with Apple Pay, you will first need to
    validate the domains you plan to host the Apple Pay Button on by:


    - Hosting Tilled's Apple Domain Verification File on the domain

    - Use the Tilled API to register the domain


    ## Domain Verification File


    Domains hosting an Apple Pay Button must be secured with HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or
    later) and have a valid SSL certificate.


    Before [registering your domain](https://api.tilled.com) with the Tilled
    API, you need to host Tilled's [Apple Domain Verification
    File](https://api.tilled.com/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association)
    on the domain at the path:
    `/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association`


    # Tilled.js


    Tilled.js is the easiest way to get started collecting payments. It allows
    you to embed a payments form in your application and stores credit card
    information securely on remote servers instead of passing through your
    network. View the documentation [here](https://docs.tilled.com/tilledjs/).


    # Webhooks


    ## Receive event notifications with webhooks


    Listen for events on your Tilled account so your integration can
    automatically trigger reactions.


    Tilled uses webhooks to notify your application when an event happens in
    your account. Webhooks are particularly useful for asynchronous events like
    when a customer’s bank confirms a payment, a customer disputes a charge, or
    a recurring payment succeeds.


    Begin using webhooks with your Tilled integration in just a couple steps:


    - Create a webhook endpoint on your server.

    - Register the endpoint with Tilled to go live.


    Not all Tilled integrations require webhooks. Keep reading to learn more
    about what webhooks are and when you should use them.


    ### What are webhooks


    _Webhooks_ refers to a combination of elements that collectively create a
    notification and reaction system within a larger integration.


    Metaphorically, webhooks are like a phone number that Tilled calls to notify
    you of activity in your Tilled account. The activity could be the creation
    of a new customer or the payout of funds to your bank account. The webhook
    endpoint is the person answering that call who takes actions based upon the
    specific information it receives.


    Non-metaphorically, the webhook endpoint is just more code on your server,
    which could be written in Ruby, PHP, Node.js, or whatever. The webhook
    endpoint has an associated URL (e.g., https://example.com/webhooks). The
    Tilled notifications are Event objects. This Event object contains all the
    relevant information about what just happened, including the type of event
    and the data associated with that event. The webhook endpoint uses the event
    details to take any required actions, such as indicating that an order
    should be fulfilled.


    ### When to use webhooks


    Many events that occur within a Tilled account have synchronous
    results–immediate and direct–to an executed request. For example, a
    successful request to create a customer immediately returns a Customer
    object. Such requests don’t require webhooks, as the key information is
    already available.


    Other events that occur within a Tilled account are asynchronous: happening
    at a later time and not directly in response to your code’s execution. Most
    commonly these involve:


    - The [Payment Intents API](https://api.tilled.com)


    With these and similar APIs, Tilled needs to notify your integration about
    changes to the status of an object so your integration can take subsequent
    steps.


    The specific actions your webhook endpoint may take differs based upon the
    event. Some examples include:


    - Updating a customer’s membership record in your database when a
    subscription payment succeeds

    - Logging an accounting entry when a transfer is paid

    - Indicating that an order can be fulfilled (i.e., boxed and shipped)


    ## Verifying signatures manually


    The `tilled-signature` header included in each signed event contains a
    timestamp and one or more signatures. The timestamp is prefixed by `t=`, and
    each signature is prefixed by a `scheme`. Schemes start with `v`, followed
    by an integer. Currently, the only valid live signature scheme is `v1`.


    ```

    tilled-signature:t=1614049713663,v1=8981f5902896f479fa9079eec71fca01e9a065c5b59a96b221544023ce994b02

    ```


    Tilled generates signatures using a hash-based message authentication code
    ([HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code))
    with [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2). You should ignore all
    schemes that are not `v1`.


    You can verify the webhook event signature by following these steps.


    ### Step 1: Extract the timestamp and signatures from the header


    Split the header, using the `,` character as the separator, to get a list of
    elements. Then split each element, using the `=` character as the separator,
    to get a prefix and value pair.


    The value for the prefix `t` corresponds to the timestamp, and `v1`
    corresponds to the signature (or signatures). You can discard all other
    elements.


    ### Step 2: Prepare the signed_payload string


    The `signed_payload` string is created by concatenating:


    - The timestamp (as a string)

    - The character `.`

    - The actual JSON payload (i.e., the request body)


    ### Step 3: Determine the expected signature


    Compute an HMAC with the SHA256 hash function. Use the endpoint’s signing
    secret as the key, and use the `signed_payload` string as the message.


    ### Step 4: Compare the signatures


    Compare the signature (or signatures) in the header to the expected
    signature. For an equality match, compute the difference between the current
    timestamp and the received timestamp, then decide if the difference is
    within your tolerance.


    To protect against timing attacks, use a constant-time string comparison to
    compare the expected signature to each of the received signatures.
