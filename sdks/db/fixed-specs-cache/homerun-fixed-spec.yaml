      # Introduction


      Welcome to the Homerun API! You can use our API to programmatically access
      your jobs and applicants in Homerun.



      ## Authentication


      All API endpoints require Bearer authentication. We'll reference this
      authentication method later in this document as `public-api-v2-key`. Example
      authentication header:


      ```http

      Authorization: Bearer <your secret API key>

      ```


      ## Authorization


      Your API key has scopes attached to it. Those scopes are used to authorize
      request to each endpoint. We recommend that you only assign scopes that you
      need to get the job done and nothing more.


      Scopes can only be assigned once, when generating a new key on the
      [Integrations Page](https://app.homerun.co/settings/integrations) page in
      the Homerun App.


      Possible scopes include:


      * `vacancies:read`

      * `job-applications:read`

      * `job-applications:write`

      * `job-application-notes:read`

      * `job-application-notes:write`

      * `job-application-files:write`


      Check endpoint documentation below to learn which scopes are required to
      make a specific request.


      ## General security advice and fair use


      Don’t share your API key in publicly accessible places such as client-side
      code or services like Github. If you suspect unauthorized usage of your key,
      please delete it on the [Integrations
      Page](https://app.homerun.co/settings/integrations) in the Homerun App.


      When assigning scopes to your API keys, follow the [principle of least
      privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) and
      only grant the scopes that are absolutely necessary for your use-case. If
      you want to use our API in multiple workflows, consider generating separate
      keys with scopes tailored to the their specific needs, rather than re-using
      the same key.


      Consider periodically rotating your API keys. You can have up to 10 active
      API keys, so you can generate new ones to replace old ones without forcing
      downtime on your workflows.


      Note that keys can have an expiry date assigned to them. You can use it for
      keys that you know in advance you'll only need for a limited time.


      If your workflow only involves fetching a list of vacancies, please consider
      using our [Job XML
      Feeds](https://help.homerun.co/en/articles/5013627-how-do-i-generate-an-xml-feed)
      feature instead.


      We enforce a rate limit of 60 requests per minute to our API to ensure fair
      usage and limit abuse.


      ## Pagination


      All endpoints returning a list of objects are using configurable pagination
      mechanism. You can adjust the number of items per page (through `perPage`
      parameter). You can fetch more objects by incrementing the `page` query
      parameter. Pagination metadata is returned in a separate, top-level `meta`
      property, providing convenience links to following pages, current pagination
      state and a total number of objects.


      Example of a `meta` object:


      ```json

      {
          "meta": {
              "current_page": 1,
              "from": 1,
              "last_page": 4,
              "links": [
                  {
                      "url": null,
                      "label": "&laquo; Previous",
                      "active": false
                  },
                  {

                      "active": false
                  }
              ],

              "per_page": 15,
              "to": 15,

      ## Changelog


      ### 21.09.2023


      * `total_candidate_count` field from `Vacancy` schema is now an optional and
      can be added using `include[]=total_candidate_count`


      ### 14.09.2023


      * `is_remote` field from `Vacancy` has been deprecated in favour of the new
      enum `location_type` field. `remote` is one of the values of the new field.
