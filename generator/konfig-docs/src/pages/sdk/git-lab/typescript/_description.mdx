An OpenAPI definition for the GitLab REST API.
Few API resources or endpoints are currently included.
The intent is to expand this to match the entire Markdown documentation of the API:
[https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/). Contributions are welcome.

When viewing this on gitlab.com, you can test API calls directly from the browser
against the `gitlab.com` instance, if you are logged in.
The feature uses the current [GitLab session cookie](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/index.html#session-cookie),
so each request is made using your account.

Instructions for using this tool can be found in [Interactive API Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/openapi/openapi_interactive.html)
