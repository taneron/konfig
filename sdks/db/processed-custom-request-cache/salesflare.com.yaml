    # Introduction


    ## Getting Started


    The Salesflare API allows you to access and build your own applications or
    integrations that interact with Salesflare.


    The Salesflare API provides a RESTful interface with JSON-formatted
    responses to access most Salesflare resources.


    ## Authentication


    The Salesflare API uses bearer token based authentication, which means you
    need to use the key-value pair "Authorization : Bearer APIKEY" in the header
    to authenticate.


    You can make an API key in ["Settings" > "API
    keys"](https://app.salesflare.com/#/settings/apikeys).


    Click on the large orange "+" button on the bottom right of the screen to
    create an API key.

    ## Requests


    All requests must be sent using HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher. Please make
    sure your developer tools support this version of TLS as older versions or
    SSL are not supported for security reasons.


    For PUT or POST requests (e.g. create, update), the payload must be provided
    as JSON in the request body.


    ## Responses


    Responses use HTTP status codes, with the most typical ones being:


    | Code                   | Meaning               |

    |------------------------|-----------------------|

    | Successful Responses                           |

    | 200                    | OK                    |

    | Error Responses                                |

    | 400                    | Bad Request           |

    | 401                    | Unauthorized          |

    | 404                    | Not Found             |
