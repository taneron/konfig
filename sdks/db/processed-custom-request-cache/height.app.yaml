    # Authentication


    The Height API uses API keys to authenticate requests. **You can view your
    API key in the Height settings under API**.


    Authentication to the API is performed via the `Authorization` header. All
    API requests should be made over HTTPs.


    i.e. Get your workspace.


    ```bash

    curl https://api.height.app/workspace \
      -H "Authorization: api-key secret_1234"
    ```


    Third-party applications must connect to the Height API using
    [OAuth2](https://www.notion.so/API-documentation-643aea5bf01742de9232e5971cb4afda). 


    See [OAuth Apps on
    Height](https://www.notion.so/OAuth-Apps-on-Height-a8ebeab3f3f047e3857bd8ce60c2f640)
    for more information.


    # Object formats


    All objects have a unique `id` ([UUID
    v4](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)))
    and a `model` attribute to distinguish the model type.


    e.g. a task object.


    ```json

    {
      "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000",
      "model": "task",
      "name": "Fix bug",
      "index": 1,
      "status": "backLog",
      [...]
    }

    ```


    # Date formats


    Every date uses the ISO format e.g.


    ```js

    "2019-11-07T17:00:00.000Z"

    ```


    # Real-time


    Any change that you make to the API will be pushed to every user in
    real-time: i.e. creating tasks or messages.


    # Rate limits


    To keep incoming traffic under control and maintain a great experience for
    all our users, our API is behind a rate limiter. Users who send many
    requests in quick succession may see error responses that show up as status
    code 429.


    Height allows up to 120 requests/min, but we have stricter limits on these
    endpoints:


    - `POST /activities`: 60 requests/min

    - `POST /tasks`: 60 requests/min
