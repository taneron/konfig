    This is the official documentation for the Hetzner Cloud API.


    ## Introduction


    The Hetzner Cloud API operates over HTTPS and uses JSON as its data format.
    The API is a RESTful API and utilizes HTTP methods and HTTP status codes to
    specify requests and responses.


    As an alternative to working directly with our API you may also consider to
    use:


    - Our CLI program [hcloud](https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli)

    - Our [library for Go](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-go)

    - Our [library for Python](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-python)


    Also you can find a [list of libraries, tools, and integrations on
    GitHub](https://github.com/hetznercloud/awesome-hcloud).


    If you are developing integrations based on our API and your product is Open
    Source you may be eligible for a free one time €50 (excl. VAT) credit on
    your account. Please contact us via the the support page on your Cloud
    Console and let us know the following:


    - The type of integration you would like to develop

    - Link to the GitHub repo you will use for the Project

    - Link to some other Open Source work you have already done (if you have
    done so)


    ## Getting Started


    To get started using the API you first need an API token. Sign in into the
    [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) choose a Project, go
    to `Security` → `API Tokens`, and generate a new token. Make sure to copy
    the token because it won’t be shown to you again. A token is bound to a
    Project, to interact with the API of another Project you have to create a
    new token inside the Project. Let’s say your new token is
    `LRK9DAWQ1ZAEFSrCNEEzLCUwhYX1U3g7wMg4dTlkkDC96fyDuyJ39nVbVjCKSDfj`.


    You’re now ready to do your first request against the API. To get a list of
    all Servers in your Project, issue the example request on the right side
    using [curl](https://curl.se/).


    Make sure to replace the token in the example command with the token you
    have just created. Since your Project probably does not contain any Servers
    yet, the example response will look like the response on the right side. We
    will almost always provide a resource root like `servers` inside the example
    response. A response can also contain a `meta` object with information like
    [Pagination](https://docs.hetzner.cloud).


    **Example Request**


    ```bash

    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer
    LRK9DAWQ1ZAEFSrCNEEzLCUwhYX1U3g7wMg4dTlkkDC96fyDuyJ39nVbVjCKSDfj" \
      https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/servers
    ```


    **Example Response**


    ```json

    {
      "servers": [],
      "meta": {
        "pagination": {
          "page": 1,
          "per_page": 25,
          "previous_page": null,
          "next_page": null,
          "last_page": 1,
          "total_entries": 0
        }
      }
    }

    ```


    ## Authentication


    All requests to the Hetzner Cloud API must be authenticated via a API token.
    Include your secret API token in every request you send to the API with the
    `Authorization` HTTP header.


    To create a new API token for your Project, switch into the [Hetzner Cloud
    Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) choose a Project, go to `Security`
    → `API Tokens`, and generate a new token.


    **Example Authorization header**


    ```http

    Authorization: Bearer
    LRK9DAWQ1ZAEFSrCNEEzLCUwhYX1U3g7wMg4dTlkkDC96fyDuyJ39nVbVjCKSDfj

    ```


    ## Errors


    Errors are indicated by HTTP status codes. Further, the response of the
    request which generated the error contains an error code, an error message,
    and, optionally, error details. The schema of the error details object
    depends on the error code.


    The error response contains the following keys:


    | Keys      |
    Meaning                                                               |

    | --------- |
    --------------------------------------------------------------------- |

    | `code`    | Short string indicating the type of error
    (machine-parsable)          |

    | `message` | Textual description on what has gone
    wrong                            |

    | `details` | An object providing for details on the error (schema depends
    on code) |


    **Example response**


    ```json

    {
      "error": {
        "code": "invalid_input",
        "message": "invalid input in field 'broken_field': is too long",
        "details": {
          "fields": [
            {
              "name": "broken_field",
              "messages": ["is too long"]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }

    ```

          ]
        }
      }
    }

    ```


    ## Labels


    Labels are `key/value` pairs that can be attached to all resources.


    Valid label keys have two segments: an optional prefix and name, separated
    by a slash (`/`). The name segment is required and must be a string of 63
    characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character
    (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`) with dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and
    alphanumerics between. The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix must
    be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots (`.`), not
    longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (`/`).


    Valid label values must be a string of 63 characters or less and must be
    empty or begin and end with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`) with
    dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics between.


    The `hetzner.cloud/` prefix is reserved and cannot be used.


    **Example Labels**


    ```json

    {
      "labels": {
        "environment": "development",
        "service": "backend",
        "example.com/my": "label",
        "just-a-key": ""
      }
    }

    ```


    ## Label Selector


    For resources with labels, you can filter resources by their labels using
    the label selector query language.


    | Expression           |
    Meaning                                              |

    | -------------------- |
    ---------------------------------------------------- |

    | `k==v` / `k=v`       | Value of key `k` does equal value
    `v`                |

    | `k!=v`               | Value of key `k` does not equal value
    `v`            |

    | `k`                  | Key `k` is
    present                                   |

    | `!k`                 | Key `k` is not
    present                               |

    | `k in (v1,v2,v3)`    | Value of key `k` is `v1`, `v2`, or
    `v3`              |

    | `k notin (v1,v2,v3)` | Value of key `k` is neither `v1`, nor `v2`, nor
    `v3` |

    | `k1==v,!k2`          | Value of key `k1` is `v` and key `k2` is not
    present |


    ### Examples


    - Returns all resources that have a `env=production` label and that don't
    have a `type=database` label:

      `env=production,type!=database`

    - Returns all resources that have a `env=testing` or `env=staging` label:

      `env in (testing,staging)`

    - Returns all resources that don't have a `type` label:

      `!type`

    ## Pagination


    Responses which return multiple items support pagination. If they do support
    pagination, it can be controlled with following query string parameters:


    - A `page` parameter specifies the page to fetch. The number of the first
    page is 1.

    - A `per_page` parameter specifies the number of items returned per page.
    The default value is 25, the maximum value is 50 except otherwise specified
    in the documentation.


    Responses contain a `Link` header with pagination information.


    Additionally, if the response body is JSON and the root object is an object,
    that object has a `pagination` object inside the `meta` object with
    pagination information:


    **Example Pagination**


    ```json

    {
        "servers": [...],
        "meta": {
            "pagination": {
                "page": 2,
                "per_page": 25,
                "previous_page": 1,
                "next_page": 3,
                "last_page": 4,
                "total_entries": 100
            }
        }
    }

    ```


    The keys `previous_page`, `next_page`, `last_page`, and `total_entries` may
    be `null` when on the first page, last page, or when the total number of
    entries is unknown.


    **Example Pagination Link header**


    ```http

    Link: <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=2&per_page=5>; rel="prev",
          <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=4&per_page=5>; rel="next",
          <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=6&per_page=5>; rel="last"
    ```


    Line breaks have been added for display purposes only and responses may only
    contain some of the above `rel` values.


    ## Rate Limiting


    All requests, whether they are authenticated or not, are subject to rate
    limiting. If you have reached your limit, your requests will be handled with
    a `429 Too Many Requests` error. Burst requests are allowed. Responses
    contain serveral headers which provide information about your current rate
    limit status.


    - The `RateLimit-Limit` header contains the total number of requests you can
    perform per hour.

    - The `RateLimit-Remaining` header contains the number of requests remaining
    in the current rate limit time frame.

    - The `RateLimit-Reset` header contains a UNIX timestamp of the point in
    time when your rate limit will have recovered and you will have the full
    number of requests available again.


    The default limit is 3600 requests per hour and per Project. The number of
    remaining requests increases gradually. For example, when your limit is 3600
    requests per hour, the number of remaining requests will increase by 1 every
    second.


    ## Server Metadata


    Your Server can discover metadata about itself by doing a HTTP request to
    specific URLs. The following data is available:


    | Data              | Format |
    Contents                                                     |

    | ----------------- | ------ |
    ------------------------------------------------------------ |

    | hostname          | text   | Name of the Server as set in the
    api                         |

    | instance-id       | number | ID of the
    server                                             |

    | public-ipv4       | text   | Primary public IPv4
    address                                  |

    | private-networks  | yaml   | Details about the private networks the Server
    is attached to |

    | availability-zone | text   | Name of the availability zone that Server
    runs in            |

    | region            | text   | Network zone, e.g.
    eu-central                                |

    ## Sorting


    Some responses which return multiple items support sorting. If they do
    support sorting the documentation states which fields can be used for
    sorting. You specify sorting with the `sort` query string parameter. You can
    sort by multiple fields. You can set the sort direction by appending `:asc`
    or `:desc` to the field name. By default, ascending sorting is used.


    **Example: Sorting**


    ```

    https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status

    https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:asc

    https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:desc

    https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:asc&sort=command:desc

    ```
